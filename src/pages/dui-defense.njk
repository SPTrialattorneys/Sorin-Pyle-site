                        <h2>Understanding Michigan OWI & DUI Charges</h2>

                        <p>Michigan law prohibits operating a vehicle while intoxicated. In Michigan, drunk driving is technically called "OWI" (Operating While Intoxicated), though many people still refer to it as "DUI." What many people don't know is that there are different types of intoxicated driving charges in Michigan, each with different penalties and implications:</p>

                                <h4>OWI (Operating While Intoxicated)</h4>
                                <p>The most common drunk driving charge. You can be charged with OWI if your BAC (blood alcohol content) is .08% or higher, or if you're under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or any combination.</p>

                                <h4>OWVI (Operating While Visibly Impaired)</h4>
                                <p>A lesser charge than OWI, OWVI is often charged when your BAC is above .00% but below .08% and you show signs of impairment. This is often a negotiated plea from an OWI charge.</p>

                                <p>If your BAC is .17% or higher, you face enhanced "super drunk" penalties including longer license suspension, mandatory alcohol monitoring, and increased fines.</p>

                                <p>Driving with any amount of Schedule 1 drugs in your system, including marijuana. This charge applies even if you weren't impaired with limited exceptions for registered Michigan Medical Marijuana Program (MMMP) patients.</p>

                    <section class="content-section">
                        <h2>How We Defend DUI Charges</h2>

                        <p>Every DUI case is different. We analyze every aspect of your arrest to identify weaknesses in the prosecution's case and build the strongest possible defense.</p>

                        <h3>Challenging the Traffic Stop</h3>
                        <p>Police need <em>reasonable suspicion</em> to pull you over. If the stop was unlawful, all evidence gathered afterward—including breathalyzer results—can be suppressed. We examine:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Did police have a legitimate reason to stop your vehicle?</li>
                            <li>Was the stop based on an anonymous tip or vague suspicion?</li>
                            <li>Did police exceed the scope of the initial stop?</li>
                            <li>Were there any constitutional violations during the stop?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Questioning Field Sobriety Tests</h3>
                        <p>Field sobriety tests are notoriously unreliable and subjective. We challenge:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Improper Administration:</strong> Were the tests administered according to NHTSA standardized procedures?</li>
                            <li><strong>Physical Conditions:</strong> Medical conditions, injuries, age, weight, and footwear affect test performance</li>
                            <li><strong>Environmental Factors:</strong> Uneven pavement, poor lighting, weather conditions, distracting traffic</li>
                            <li><strong>Officer Training:</strong> Was the officer properly certified to administer these tests?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Attacking Breathalyzer Results</h3>
                        <p>Breathalyzer machines are not infallible. We investigate:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Machine Calibration:</strong> Was the device properly maintained and calibrated?</li>
                            <li><strong>Operator Error:</strong> Did the officer follow proper protocols?</li>
                            <li><strong>15-Minute Observation Period:</strong> Michigan law requires officers to observe you continuously for 15 minutes before administering the breath test to ensure you don't burp, vomit, or put anything in your mouth. If this wasn't done, the test results may be inadmissible.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mouth Alcohol:</strong> Could residual mouth alcohol (from dental work, GERD, etc.) have caused a false reading?</li>
                            <li><strong>Radio Frequency Interference:</strong> Can we demonstrate equipment malfunction?</li>
                            <li><strong>Medical Conditions:</strong> Diabetes, ketosis, or other conditions that can cause false positives</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Challenging Blood Test Results</h3>
                        <p>Blood tests are considered more accurate than breath tests, but they're still challengeable:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Chain of Custody:</strong> Can the prosecution prove your blood wasn't contaminated or mixed up?</li>
                            <li><strong>Improper Draw:</strong> Was the blood drawn by a qualified person using proper procedures?</li>
                            <li><strong>Storage and Preservation:</strong> Was the blood stored properly? Fermentation can increase BAC over time</li>
                            <li><strong>Lack of Consent:</strong> If you didn't consent, was a warrant properly obtained?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Proving You Weren't Driving</h3>
                        <p>In some cases, police didn't actually see you driving. If you were:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sleeping in a parked car</li>
                            <li>Sitting in a parking lot with the engine off</li>
                            <li>Found after an accident with no witnesses</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The prosecution must <em>prove beyond a reasonable doubt</em> that you were operating the vehicle while intoxicated. If they can't, we push for dismissal.</p>

                        <h3>Necessity Defense</h3>
                        <p>In rare cases, driving while impaired may be justified:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Medical emergency (you or passenger)</li>
                            <li>Fleeing imminent danger</li>
                            <li>No reasonable alternative was available</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Negotiating Reduced Charges</h3>
                        <p>When trial isn't the best option, we negotiate aggressively for reduced charges:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>OWI to OWVI:</strong> Lesser charge with reduced penalties and shorter license suspension (90 days vs 180 days, $300 max fine vs $500)</li>
                            <li><strong>OWI to Reckless Driving:</strong> Non-alcohol related charge (no DUI on record, no mandatory license suspension)</li>
                            <li><strong>Reduced Jail Time:</strong> House arrest, work release, or community service alternatives</li>
                        </ul>

                                    <p>Missing this deadline means you lose your license for a full year—even if you're found not guilty of the criminal charge. An attorney can help you request this hearing and protect your driving privileges.</p>

                                <summary>What's the difference between the roadside breath test and the chemical test after arrest?</summary>
                                <p>Michigan has two different breath tests with very different consequences:</p>
                                <p><strong>Roadside Preliminary Breath Test (PBT):</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Administered <em>before</em> arrest at the traffic stop</li>
                                    <li>Refusing is a civil infraction ($150 fine) but NOT a crime</li>
                                    <li>Does NOT trigger automatic license suspension</li>
                                    <li>Results generally not admissible at trial (only used to establish probable cause for arrest)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Post-Arrest Chemical Test (Implied Consent):</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Administered <em>after</em> arrest (breathalyzer or blood draw)</li>
                                    <li>Refusing triggers automatic 1-year license suspension (2 years for second refusal)</li>
                                    <li>You have only <strong>14 days</strong> to request a hearing to challenge the suspension</li>
                                    <li>Refusal can be used as evidence of guilt at trial</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> You can refuse the roadside PBT with minimal consequences. Refusing the post-arrest chemical test has serious license consequences—but having no BAC number can sometimes make it harder for prosecutors to prove their case.

                                <summary>Will I go to jail for a first-time DUI?</summary>
                                <p>For a standard first offense OWI, jail is <em>possible</em> (up to 93 days) but not <em>mandatory</em>. Many first-time offenders avoid jail through:</p>

                                    <li>Negotiated plea agreements (reduction to OWVI or reckless driving)</li>

                                <p><strong>However</strong>, jail becomes more likely if:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Your BAC was very high (super drunk .17%+)</li>
                                    <li>You caused an accident or injury</li>
                                    <li>You have prior alcohol-related driving incidents</li>
                                    <li>You were driving recklessly or with children in the car</li>

                                <p><strong>First Offense OWI:</strong> 30 days hard suspension, then 150 days restricted (can drive to/from work, school, medical appointments)</p>
                                <p><strong>First Offense Super Drunk:</strong> 1 year hard suspension, but you can apply for restricted license after 45 days with ignition interlock</p>
                                <p><strong>Second Offense (within 7 years):</strong> Minimum 1 year <em>revocation</em> (eligible to petition for reinstatement after 1 year)</p>

                                <p><strong>Reduced charges: Yes, sometimes possible through negotiation.</strong></p>
                                <p>We frequently negotiate OWI charges down to lesser offenses:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>OWI to OWVI (Operating While Visibly Impaired):</strong> Lesser charge with significantly reduced penalties (90-day license restriction vs 180 days, $300 max fine vs $500, 4 points vs 6 points)</li>
                                    <li><strong>OWI to Reckless Driving:</strong> Non-alcohol traffic offense (no DUI on record, no mandatory license suspension)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Expungement: Yes, but with limitations.</strong></p>
                                <p>Michigan law now allows you to <a href="/record-expungement.html">expunge (set aside) a first offense OWI conviction</a>, but only if:</p>

                                </ul>
                                <p>Even with expungement, the conviction still counts as a prior offense for future DUI purposes.</p>

                                <summary>Can I refuse field sobriety tests?</summary>
                                <p><strong>Yes, you can refuse</strong> field sobriety tests (walking a line, standing on one leg, following a pen with your eyes). Unlike the breathalyzer, there is <em>no automatic penalty</em> for refusing these <em>roadside</em> tests.</p>
                                <p><strong>Reasons to refuse:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>They're designed for you to fail (70% of sober people fail)</li>
                                    <li>They're subjective and based on officer's opinion</li>
                                    <li>Medical conditions, age, weight, and shoes affect performance</li>
                                    <li>You're providing evidence against yourself</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>However:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Police can still arrest you if they have other evidence of impairment</li>
                                    <li>Refusal can be mentioned at trial (though we can argue why you refused)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>In general, field sobriety tests rarely help you and often hurt your case. But every situation is different.</p>

                                <p>"I only had one drink" or "I only had two beers" are the most common statements and can lead to convictions. Police aren't your friends. They're gathering evidence against you. Exercise your right to remain silent and call a lawyer immediately.</p>

                                <h4>❌ Posting on Social Media</h4>
                                <p>Prosecutors check Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. That joke you made about getting arrested? That photo from the bar that night? That complaint about your attorney? All admissible evidence against you. Stay off social media until your case is closed.</p>

                                <h4>❌ Missing Court Dates or Ignoring the Charges</h4>
                                <p>Failing to appear in court results in a bench warrant for your arrest and additional charges. Ignoring the problem makes everything worse. Face it head-on with an attorney by your side.</p>
