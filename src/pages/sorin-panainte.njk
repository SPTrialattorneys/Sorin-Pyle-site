                <h1>Sorin Panainte</h1>
                <p>As a first-generation immigrant, I learned early on what it means to fight for a place in the world. That fighting spirit is what I bring to every single case. After years serving as a Public Defender, I saw firsthand how good people can get trapped in a system that is often overwhelming and unforgiving.</p>
                <p>I founded this firm on the principle that every client deserves more than just a lawyer; they deserve a dedicated advocate who will listen to their story, believe in them, and tirelessly defend their future. I am committed to standing by your side and being your champion in the courtroom.</p>
