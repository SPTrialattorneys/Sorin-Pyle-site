A misdemeanor conviction can still result in jail time, fines, a criminal record, and other consequences like the loss of a professional license. An experienced attorney can navigate the court system, identify weaknesses in the prosecution's case, and work to achieve a much better outcome than you might on your own."

For more serious crimes, called felonies, the District Court only handles the initial stages, like the arraignment and preliminary examination. If the District Court judge finds there is enough evidence, the felony case is transferred to the Circuit Court, which has the authority to handle felony trials and sentencing."

The prosecutor must present evidence to convince the judge that there is probable cause to believe a felony was committed and that the defendant committed it. If the judge agrees, the case is bound over (transferred) to the Circuit Court for trial. It is a critical opportunity for your attorney to challenge the prosecution's evidence early on."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "A plea bargain is a negotiated agreement between the defendant and the prosecutor. Typically, the defendant agrees to plead guilty to a lesser charge or to one of several charges in exchange for a more lenient sentence or the dismissal of other charges. It avoids the risk and expense of a trial, but it's crucial to have an experienced attorney negotiate on your behalf to ensure the deal is in your best interest."
