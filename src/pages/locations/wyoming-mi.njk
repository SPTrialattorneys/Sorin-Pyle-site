                <h2>Why You Need Experienced Wyoming Defense Attorneys</h2>

                <p>Wyoming's 61st District Court is one of the busiest in Michigan. With a large population, diverse demographics, and active law enforcement, criminal charges in Wyoming require attorneys who know this court system:</p>

                    <div class="advantage-item">
                        <h4>📍 We Know Wyoming's 61st District Court</h4>

                        <p>The 61st District Court's high caseload means prosecutors often push for quick plea deals to move cases along. Without experienced representation, you may be pressured into unfavorable agreements. We know when to fight, when to negotiate, and how to slow down the process when it benefits your defense.</p>

                        <p>Wyoming Police Department conducts aggressive enforcement along major corridors like Byron Center Avenue, Division Avenue, 28th Street, and residential areas. DUI patrols, narcotics investigations, and domestic violence responses are extremely active. We've defended hundreds of cases involving Wyoming police and know how to challenge their procedures and evidence.</p>

                <h2>Common Criminal Charges in Wyoming, MI</h2>

                <p>We defend Wyoming residents against all types of criminal charges, including:</p>

                <div class="grid_2-col margin-bottom-lg">
                    <div>
                        <h3>DUI / OWI in Wyoming</h3>
                        <p>Wyoming police conduct aggressive DUI enforcement along Division Avenue, Byron Center Avenue, 28th Street, and major corridors connecting to Grand Rapids. Sobriety checkpoints and saturation patrols are common, especially during weekends and holidays. Kent County prosecutors are notoriously tough on drunk driving, but we know how to challenge breathalyzer results, field sobriety tests, and police procedures. <a href="/dui-defense.html">Learn more about our DUI defense services</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Domestic Violence</h3>
                        <p>Domestic violence arrests are extremely common in Wyoming. Police respond to domestic calls daily across the city, and Michigan law requires officers to arrest someone when they believe assault occurred. Many cases involve exaggerated allegations, false accusations during custody disputes, or mutual combat where only one person gets arrested. A domestic violence conviction means loss of gun rights, custody issues, and immigration consequences. We fight these charges aggressively. <a href="/domestic-violence-defense.html">Learn more about domestic violence defense</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Drug Crimes</h3>
                        <p>Wyoming police and the Kent Area Narcotics Enforcement Team (KANET) actively investigate drug crimes throughout the city. From simple possession of marijuana to possession with intent to deliver methamphetamine, cocaine, or fentanyl, drug charges are prosecuted aggressively in Kent County. We challenge illegal searches, confidential informant reliability, and police procedures to fight your drug case.</p>

                        <h3>Gun Crimes</h3>
                        <p>Carrying a concealed weapon (CCW) without a permit, felon in possession of a firearm, and weapons charges are serious felonies. Wyoming police actively investigate firearms offenses, and Kent County prosecutors pursue these cases vigorously. If you're facing gun charges, you need experienced defense immediately.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Assault & Violent Crimes</h3>
                        <p>From simple assault and battery to aggravated assault and felonious assault, Wyoming prosecutors charge violent crimes aggressively. Bar fights, disputes at local businesses, neighborhood altercations—these situations escalate quickly and result in serious charges. We defend by demonstrating self-defense, challenging witness credibility, and negotiating reduced charges.</p>

                        <h3>Retail Fraud & Theft</h3>
                        <p>Retail fraud (shoplifting) charges are common in Wyoming, with major retailers like Meijer, Walmart, and businesses along 28th Street actively pursuing charges. Theft convictions destroy employment opportunities and professional licenses. We fight to protect your record through dismissals, diversion programs, or reduced charges.</p>

                        <h3>Traffic Offenses</h3>
                        <p>Reckless driving, driving while license suspended (DWLS), fleeing and eluding police, and leaving the scene of an accident are serious criminal offenses in Michigan. Wyoming police write thousands of tickets annually, and many escalate to criminal charges. We help protect your license and avoid convictions.</p>

                        <h3>Probation Violations</h3>
                        <p>With Wyoming's high volume of criminal cases, many residents are on probation. Violating probation conditions—missed drug tests, new arrests, failure to pay fines—can result in jail time. We defend probation violation hearings and fight to keep you out of custody.</p>

                <h2>Wyoming Police Department Enforcement Patterns</h2>

                <p>Wyoming Police Department is an active law enforcement agency with approximately 100 officers serving the city. Common enforcement patterns include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>DUI checkpoints and saturation patrols</strong> along Division Avenue, Byron Center Avenue, and 28th Street</li>
                    <li><strong>Narcotics investigations</strong> often involving confidential informants and controlled buys</li>
                    <li><strong>Domestic violence responses</strong> with mandatory arrest policies</li>

                    <li><strong>Gang unit activity</strong> investigating firearms, drugs, and violent crimes</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We've defended countless cases involving Wyoming police and know their common procedures, weaknesses in their investigations, and how to challenge their evidence.</p>

                <h2>Protecting Your Rights in Wyoming</h2>

                <p>When you're charged with a crime in Wyoming, you're facing serious consequences:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Jail time or prison sentences</li>
                    <li>Fines and court costs</li>
                    <li>Probation with strict conditions</li>
                    <li>A permanent criminal record</li>
                    <li>Loss of employment</li>

                    <li>Loss of gun rights (for domestic violence and felonies)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Our job is to protect you from these consequences.

When trial isn't the best option, we negotiate aggressively for favorable outcomes.</p>

                <h2>What to Do If You're Arrested in Wyoming</h2>

                <p>If Wyoming police arrest you, follow these critical steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Invoke your right to remain silent.</strong> DO NOT talk to police without a lawyer present. Tell them, "I am invoking my right to remain silent, and I want to speak with an attorney."</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not consent to searches.</strong> Police may ask to search your car, phone, home, or belongings. Politely say, "I do not consent to any searches."</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not resist arrest.</strong> Even if the arrest is unjust, do not physically resist. Resisting arrest is an additional criminal charge.</li>
                    <li><strong>Call an attorney immediately.</strong> The sooner we start working on your case, the better your chances. Call us at <strong>(616) 227-3303</strong> as soon as you're released or have access to a phone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Document everything.</strong> Write down what happened, names of witnesses, officer badge numbers, and any evidence that supports your innocence. Take photos of injuries or property damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do NOT post on social media.</strong> Prosecutors will review your Facebook, Instagram, and other accounts looking for evidence against you.</li>
                </ol>
