                <h2>Common Criminal Charges in Jenison, MI</h2>

                <p>We defend Jenison residents against all types of criminal charges, including:</p>

                <div class="grid_2-col margin-bottom-lg">
                    <div>
                        <h3>DUI / OWI Charges</h3>
                        <p>Jenison police and Ottawa County Sheriff's deputies conduct frequent traffic stops and DUI enforcement along Chicago Drive, Baldwin Street, and Port Sheldon Street. DUI arrests often occur near restaurants and bars along the commercial corridors. If you've been arrested for drunk driving in Jenison, we can challenge breathalyzer results, field sobriety tests, and the legality of the traffic stop. <a href="/dui-defense.html">Learn more about our DUI defense services</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Domestic Violence</h3>
                        <p>Domestic violence arrests are common in suburban communities like Jenison. Police are required to make an arrest when called to a domestic disturbance, even if no injuries occurred and the alleged victim wants charges dropped. Ottawa County prosecutors pursue these cases aggressively. We defend against false accusations, mutual combat situations, and cases where you acted in self-defense. A domestic violence conviction carries serious consequences—loss of gun rights, potential jail time, and a permanent criminal record that can affect your family and employment. <a href="/domestic-violence-defense.html">Learn more about domestic violence defense</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Drug Charges</h3>
                        <p>Drug charges in Jenison typically arise from traffic stops, search warrants at residences, or school-related incidents. Whether you're facing possession of marijuana (over legal limits), cocaine, methamphetamine, prescription drugs, or more serious charges like possession with intent to deliver, we provide aggressive defense. Many drug cases can be resolved through diversion programs, reduced charges, or outright dismissals when police violated your rights.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Theft & Retail Fraud</h3>
                        <p>Retail fraud (shoplifting) charges in Jenison often arise from stores along Chicago Drive and nearby retail areas. Even first-time offenders face criminal records, fines, and potential jail time. We work to have charges dismissed, negotiate civil settlements, or reduce charges to avoid a theft conviction that will follow you for life.</p>

                        <h3>Assault & Battery</h3>
                        <p>Assault charges in Jenison can arise from neighborhood disputes, school-related incidents, or altercations at local businesses. We defend clients by demonstrating self-defense, challenging witness credibility, and negotiating reduced charges. Assault convictions can result in jail time, probation, and a violent crime on your record.</p>

                        <h3>Traffic Offenses</h3>
                        <p>Reckless driving, driving while license suspended (DWLS), leaving the scene of an accident, and other serious traffic offenses can result in jail time, license suspension, and a criminal record. Georgetown Township police actively enforce traffic laws on major roads like Chicago Drive and Baldwin Street. We help Jenison drivers protect their licenses and avoid criminal convictions.</p>

                        <h3>Juvenile Offenses</h3>
                        <p>Jenison is home to many families with teenagers, and juvenile offenses can have serious long-term consequences. We defend minors charged with MIP (minor in possession), drug offenses, assault, theft, and other crimes. Our goal is to protect young people's futures by keeping charges off their permanent records.</p>

                <h2>What to Do If You're Arrested in Jenison</h2>

                <p>If Georgetown Township police or Ottawa County Sheriff's deputies arrest you in Jenison, follow these steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Remain silent.</strong> Do NOT talk to police without a lawyer present. Anything you say WILL be used against you. Invoke your right to remain silent and request an attorney immediately.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not consent to searches.</strong> Police may ask to search your car, phone, or home. Politely decline and say you do not consent to searches. Do not physically resist, but make it clear you are not giving permission.</li>
                    <li><strong>Call an attorney immediately.</strong> The sooner we start working on your case, the better your outcome. Call us at <strong>(616) 227-3303</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not post about your case on social media.</strong> Prosecutors will review your Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and other accounts looking for evidence against you. Anything you post can and will be used in court.</li>
                    <li><strong>Document everything.</strong> Write down what happened while it's fresh in your mind, including names of witnesses, photos of injuries or the scene, and any evidence supporting your defense.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not talk to the alleged victim (in domestic cases).</strong> If you're arrested for domestic violence, do NOT contact the alleged victim—this will result in additional charges for violating a no-contact order.</li>
                    <li><strong>Protect your family's privacy.</strong> In a close-knit community like Jenison, criminal charges can become public quickly. We work to resolve cases as quietly and favorably as possible to protect your family's reputation.</li>
                </ol>
