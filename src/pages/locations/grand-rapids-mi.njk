                <h2>Defending Criminal Charges in Grand Rapids</h2>

                <p>Grand Rapids presents unique challenges for criminal defendants. The Kent County Prosecutor's Office is one of the largest in Michigan, with significant resources and experienced prosecutors who handle thousands of cases annually. The courts move quickly, and without experienced representation, you can easily get lost in the system or pressured into unfavorable plea deals.</p>

                <p>We've successfully defended clients throughout Grand Rapids against all types of charges:</p>

                <div class="grid_2-col margin-bottom-lg">
                    <div>
                        <h3>DUI / OWI in Grand Rapids</h3>
                        <p>Grand Rapids police conduct aggressive DUI enforcement, especially along major corridors like 28th Street, Division Avenue, Lake Michigan Drive, and downtown during ArtPrize, festivals, and nightlife hours. Kent County prosecutors are notoriously tough on drunk driving cases, but we know how to challenge breathalyzer results, question police procedures, and find weaknesses in their case. <a href="/dui-defense.html">Learn more about DUI defense</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Domestic Violence Charges</h3>
                        <p>Domestic violence arrests are extremely common in Grand Rapids. Police respond to domestic calls daily, and Michigan law requires officers to arrest someone when they believe assault occurred. Many cases involve exaggerated allegations, false accusations during custody disputes, or mutual combat where only one person gets arrested. We defend your rights and fight to avoid the devastating consequences of a DV conviction—including loss of custody, loss of gun rights, and immigration consequences. <a href="/domestic-violence-defense.html">Learn more about domestic violence defense</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Drug Crimes</h3>
                        <p>The Kent Area Narcotics Enforcement Team (KANET) and Grand Rapids Police Department's narcotics unit actively investigate drug crimes throughout the city. Whether you're facing possession charges, possession with intent to deliver, conspiracy, or federal drug trafficking charges, we provide aggressive defense. Many drug cases involve illegal searches, confidential informants, and questionable police tactics that we can challenge.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Violent Crimes & Assault</h3>
                        <p>Grand Rapids prosecutors aggressively charge assault and battery, felonious assault, and more serious violent crimes. Bar fights, disputes on Division Avenue, altercations during events—these situations escalate quickly and result in serious charges. We defend clients by demonstrating self-defense, challenging witness credibility, and negotiating reduced charges.</p>

                        <h3>Theft, Fraud & Property Crimes</h3>
                        <p>From retail fraud at Woodland Mall and Rivertown Crossings to embezzlement, identity theft, and receiving stolen property, property crimes are prosecuted vigorously in Kent County. A theft conviction can destroy employment opportunities and professional licenses. We fight to protect your record.</p>

                        <h3>Gun Crimes</h3>
                        <p>Carrying a concealed weapon (CCW) without a permit, felon in possession of a firearm, and weapons charges are serious felonies in Michigan. Grand Rapids police and GRPD's gang unit actively investigate firearms offenses. If you're facing gun charges, you need experienced defense immediately.</p>

                <h2>What to Do If You're Arrested in Grand Rapids</h2>

                <p>If Grand Rapids police or Kent County Sheriff's deputies arrest you, follow these critical steps:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Invoke your right to remain silent.</strong> DO NOT talk to police without a lawyer present. Tell them, "I am invoking my right to remain silent, and I want to speak with an attorney."</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not consent to searches.</strong> Police may ask to search your car, phone, home, or belongings. Politely say, "I do not consent to any searches."</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not resist arrest.</strong> Even if the arrest is unjust, do not physically resist. Resisting arrest is an additional criminal charge that makes your case much worse.</li>
                    <li><strong>Call an attorney immediately.</strong> The sooner we start working on your case, the better your chances. Call us at <strong>(616) 227-3303</strong> as soon as you're released or have access to a phone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not post bail until you've talked to a lawyer.</strong> Sometimes posting bail immediately isn't the best strategy. We can advise you on whether to wait or post bail right away.</li>
                    <li><strong>Document everything.</strong> Write down what happened, names of witnesses, officer badge numbers, and any evidence that supports your innocence. Take photos of injuries, property damage, or anything relevant.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do NOT post on social media.</strong> Prosecutors will review your Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok looking for evidence against you. Assume everything you post online will be shown to a jury.</li>
                </ol>

                <hr class="hr-divider">
