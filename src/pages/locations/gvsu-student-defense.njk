This is FAR below the 0.08% adult OWI standard. Essentially, any alcohol consumption means you cannot legally drive if you're under 21. One standard drink can put you over the 0.02% limit. Penalties include license suspension (30 days for first offense), fines up to $250, 4 points on driving record, community service, and substance abuse screening. More importantly, it triggers GVSU Student Conduct proceedings which can result in housing loss, scholarship revocation, and professional program consequences."

GVSU can take disciplinary action including housing probation or removal, parking privileges revocation, and disciplinary probation. Merit scholarships (Presidential Scholarship, Dean's Scholarship, departmental funding) often require 'good standing' - disciplinary probation can trigger immediate scholarship loss. Athletic scholarships are particularly vulnerable - team suspension and scholarship revocation are common. Private scholarships from churches, community organizations, or donors may have conduct clauses violated by alcohol offenses. Once scholarships are lost, they are rarely reinstated even if criminal charges are later reduced."

Nursing students: license suspension prevents completion of required clinical rotations; Michigan Board of Nursing reviews criminal history including alcohol offenses for licensure. Education majors: cannot complete student teaching without reliable transportation to placements; Michigan teaching certification reviews criminal history. Business, engineering, and health sciences: internships and co-op placements become inaccessible without valid license and clean record. Graduate schools (medical school, law school, etc.) require criminal history disclosure on applications, and alcohol offenses are reviewed carefully by admissions committees."

                <h2>Criminal Charges Can Destroy Your GVSU Career Before It Even Starts</h2>
                <p>You worked hard to get into Grand Valley State University. You're building toward a career, maybe in nursing at the Pew Campus, education, business, or one of GVSU's many competitive programs. A single criminal charge - even a minor offense like MIP or fake ID - can derail everything you've worked for.</p>

                <p>We get it. You're scared. You're worried about your parents finding out. You're panicking about losing your scholarship or getting kicked out of your major. You're wondering if one mistake will follow you forever. You're not sure whether to talk to the police, GVSU administrators, or anyone else.</p>

                <p><strong>Take a breath. We've helped hundreds of college students through exactly this situation.</strong></p>

                <p>At Sorin & Pyle, we don't judge. We don't lecture. We defend. Whether you were at an off-campus party in Allendale, downtown Grand Rapids near Pew Campus, or anywhere else in West Michigan, we know how to protect your rights AND your future at GVSU.</p>

                <h2>Understanding GVSU's Dual Campus Challenge</h2>
                <p>Grand Valley State University is unique among Michigan universities because of its dual-campus structure. This creates a complicated legal situation that most attorneys don't understand. <strong>Where you were arrested determines which court hears your case, and the two court systems have very different approaches to student cases.</strong></p>

                <h3>Allendale Campus - 58th District Court (Hudsonville Division)</h3>
                <p>If you were arrested on or near GVSU's main Allendale campus, your case will be prosecuted in the 58th District Court, Hudsonville Division (3100 Port Sheldon Street, Hudsonville, MI 49426). This court serves Ottawa County and handles thousands of GVSU student cases every year.</p>

                <p>The 58th District Court sees regular GVSU student arrests for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>MIP (Minor in Possession) at off-campus house parties</li>
                    <li>Fake ID offenses at Allendale bars</li>
                    <li>Disorderly conduct at parties (especially during Welcome Week and homecoming)</li>
                    <li>Marijuana possession (even with Michigan's legalization, it's still illegal for those under 21)</li>
                    <li>Noise violations and open intoxicant</li>
                    <li>DUI/OWI on 48th Avenue or Lake Michigan Drive</li>
                </ul>

                <p>With over 6,000 students living on the Allendale campus in residence halls and apartments, plus thousands more in nearby off-campus housing, party-related arrests are extremely common. Ottawa County Sheriff's deputies and GVSU Police work together to enforce laws aggressively, especially during peak party times.</p>

                <h3>Pew Campus (Downtown Grand Rapids) - 61st District Court</h3>
                <p>If you attend classes at GVSU's Pew Campus in downtown Grand Rapids - home to professional programs including nursing, education, engineering, and health sciences - arrests in that area are prosecuted in 61st District Court (180 Ottawa Ave NW, Grand Rapids, MI 49503).</p>

                <p>Pew Campus students face unique concerns:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Professional program requirements:</strong> Nursing, education, and health professions students must maintain clean records for state licensing</li>
                    <li><strong>Urban enforcement:</strong> Grand Rapids Police patrol downtown heavily, with frequent stops for pedestrian violations, open intoxicant, and fake IDs at downtown bars</li>
                    <li><strong>Higher stakes:</strong> Many Pew Campus students are in their junior/senior years or graduate programs - closer to graduation means more to lose</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>The bottom line: GVSU students need an attorney who regularly practices in BOTH 58th District Court (Hudsonville) AND 61st District Court (Grand Rapids).</strong> We do. We know the judges, prosecutors, and procedures in both courts, and we know how to navigate the jurisdictional complexity that GVSU's dual-campus structure creates.</p>

                <h2>Understanding Dual Proceedings: Criminal Court vs. GVSU Disciplinary Process</h2>
                <p>Here's what most GVSU students don't realize: <strong>getting arrested doesn't just mean criminal court. You may also face a completely separate disciplinary process through GVSU's Student Code of Conduct.</strong></p>

                <p>This means you could be fighting on two fronts simultaneously:</p>

                <h3>Criminal Court Proceedings</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prosecuted by Ottawa County Prosecutor (Allendale) or Kent County Prosecutor (Grand Rapids)</li>
                    <li>Constitutional rights apply (right to remain silent, right to attorney, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Burden of proof: "Beyond a reasonable doubt"</li>
                    <li>Potential outcomes: Conviction, plea deal, dismissal, diversion programs</li>
                    <li>Consequences: Jail time, fines, probation, criminal record</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>GVSU Student Code Proceedings</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conducted by GVSU Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution</li>
                    <li>Lower burden of proof: "Preponderance of the evidence" (more likely than not)</li>
                    <li>Limited due process rights compared to criminal court</li>
                    <li>Potential outcomes: Warning, probation, suspension, expulsion</li>
                    <li>Consequences: Loss of campus housing, removal from academic programs, notation on transcript, permanent expulsion</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Important: GVSU can discipline you even if you're found not guilty in criminal court.</strong> The university uses a lower standard of evidence. They can also take action for off-campus conduct if they believe it violates the Student Code.</p>

                <p>Additionally, some GVSU programs require students to self-report arrests:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nursing students:</strong> Must report arrests to program directors</li>
                    <li><strong>Education majors:</strong> Required to disclose for field placements and student teaching</li>
                    <li><strong>Social work students:</strong> Must report for field placement background checks</li>
                    <li><strong>Other professional programs:</strong> May have reporting requirements</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Failing to report when required can result in immediate dismissal from the program - even if the criminal charges are eventually dropped.</p>

                <h2>Common Criminal Charges for GVSU Students</h2>

                <h3>Minor in Possession of Alcohol (MIP)</h3>
                <p>MIP is by far the most common charge for GVSU students. Under Michigan law (MCL 436.1703), if you're under 21 with any blood alcohol content over 0.02%, you can be charged.</p>

                <p><strong>Current Michigan MIP Law (effective 2018):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>First offense:</strong> Civil infraction (not a criminal misdemeanor), fine up to $100</li>
                    <li><strong>Second offense:</strong> Misdemeanor, up to 30 days in jail, doubled fines</li>
                    <li><strong>Third offense:</strong> Misdemeanor, up to 60 days in jail, up to $500 fine</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Even though a first MIP is now a civil infraction, it still appears on background checks and can trigger GVSU disciplinary action. Many GVSU scholarships have conduct requirements that may be violated by an MIP.</p>

                <p><strong>Common MIP scenarios for GVSU students:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Caught drinking at off-campus house parties (especially on 48th Avenue near campus)</li>
                    <li>Walking home from parties with open containers</li>
                    <li>Attending residence hall parties that get broken up</li>
                    <li>Tailgating at GVSU football games</li>
                    <li>Beach parties at Lake Michigan</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Fake ID Possession and Use</h3>
                <p>Using a fake ID to buy alcohol or get into bars is a misdemeanor in Michigan. Police and bar owners have gotten much more aggressive about prosecuting fake ID cases in recent years.</p>

                <p><strong>What happens:</strong> In the past, a bouncer might just confiscate your fake ID. Now, they often call police, who file criminal charges. You'll be arrested and charged with a misdemeanor that carries potential jail time.</p>

                <p>This is particularly common at:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Downtown Grand Rapids bars (near Pew Campus)</li>
                    <li>Allendale bars and restaurants near campus</li>
                    <li>Gas stations and liquor stores checking IDs more carefully</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why this matters for GVSU students:</strong> A fake ID conviction is a crime of dishonesty. This is particularly damaging for students planning careers in nursing, education, business, or law. Professional licensing boards view dishonesty offenses very seriously.</p>

                <h3>Drug Possession Charges</h3>
                <p>Even though Michigan legalized recreational marijuana, <strong>it's still illegal for anyone under 21.</strong> GVSU students can be charged with marijuana possession if found with any amount.</p>

                <p><strong>Marijuana charges for GVSU students:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use or possession by person under 21: Civil infraction, $100 fine (first offense)</li>
                    <li>Second offense: Civil infraction, $500 fine</li>
                    <li>But: Can still trigger GVSU discipline and affect federal financial aid</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Other drug charges (prescription pills, cocaine, MDMA, etc.):</strong> These are serious criminal charges that can result in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Immediate loss of federal financial aid eligibility (FAFSA question about drug convictions)</li>
                    <li>Suspension or expulsion from GVSU</li>
                    <li>Permanent criminal record affecting professional licensing</li>
                    <li>Potential jail or prison time for delivery/distribution charges</li>
                </ul>

                <p>GVSU students studying pharmacy, nursing, pre-med, or any health profession face career-ending consequences from drug convictions. State licensing boards routinely deny licenses to applicants with drug-related criminal records.</p>

                <h3>DUI/OWI Charges</h3>
                <p>GVSU students ages 21-22 (and sometimes younger students with fake IDs) face <a href="/dui-defense.html">DUI/OWI charges</a> when driving after drinking.</p>

                <p><strong>Michigan's Zero Tolerance Law for drivers under 21:</strong> If you're under 21, you can be charged with OWI if your BAC is 0.02% or higher (basically any alcohol). This is far below the 0.08% standard for adults.</p>

                <p><strong>Consequences of OWI for GVSU students:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Driver's license suspension (how will you get to campus or internships?)</li>
                    <li>Jail time possible even for first offense</li>
                    <li>Criminal record affecting job applications and professional licensing</li>
                    <li>Insurance rates skyrocket</li>
                    <li>May trigger GVSU disciplinary action</li>
                    <li>Loss of campus parking privileges</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Michigan's Zero Tolerance Law: Critical Information for Underage GVSU Students</h2>
                <p>If you're a GVSU student under 21 years old, you need to understand Michigan's "Zero Tolerance" law. <strong>This law makes it illegal to drive with ANY detectable alcohol in your system - even amounts far below what would impair an adult driver.</strong></p>

                <h3>What is Michigan's Zero Tolerance Law?</h3>
                <p>Michigan's Zero Tolerance Law (MCL 257.625(6)) makes it illegal for anyone under 21 to operate a vehicle with a blood alcohol content (BAC) of <strong>0.02% or higher</strong>. To put this in perspective:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Adult OWI threshold:</strong> 0.08% BAC (standard drunk driving)</li>
                    <li><strong>Zero Tolerance threshold (under 21):</strong> 0.02% BAC</li>
                    <li><strong>What 0.02% means:</strong> As little as ONE standard drink can put you over the limit</li>
                    <li><strong>Margin of error:</strong> Virtually zero - any alcohol consumption means you cannot legally drive</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Important: The 0.02% threshold exists only to account for measurement error and substances like mouthwash or cough syrup.</strong> Michigan law effectively prohibits ANY alcohol consumption before driving if you're under 21.</p>

                <h3>How Little Alcohol Triggers Zero Tolerance Violations?</h3>
                <p>GVSU students are shocked to learn how little alcohol can result in a Zero Tolerance charge:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>One 12-ounce beer (5% ABV):</strong> Can produce 0.02-0.03% BAC in a 120-pound person</li>
                    <li><strong>One 5-ounce glass of wine:</strong> Can produce 0.02-0.04% BAC depending on body weight</li>
                    <li><strong>One standard mixed drink:</strong> Can easily exceed 0.02% BAC</li>
                    <li><strong>Tailgating or party before driving:</strong> Even hours later, you may still be over 0.02%</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Common GVSU scenarios leading to Zero Tolerance arrests:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Having one drink at an off-campus party, then driving home hours later</li>
                    <li>Tailgating at GVSU football games, then driving</li>
                    <li>Drinking the night before, driving to morning classes with residual BAC</li>
                    <li>Being the "designated driver" but having "just one drink"</li>
                    <li>Traffic stop for minor violation (broken taillight, rolling stop) revealing any alcohol</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Legal Penalties for Zero Tolerance Violations</h3>
                <p><strong>First Zero Tolerance Offense (under 21, BAC 0.02-0.07%):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Classification:</strong> Civil infraction (not a misdemeanor, but still serious)</li>
                    <li><strong>Fine:</strong> Up to $250</li>
                    <li><strong>License sanctions:</strong> 30-day license suspension, plus 60-day restricted license (work/school only)</li>
                    <li><strong>Points:</strong> 4 points added to driving record</li>
                    <li><strong>Community service:</strong> Up to 45 hours may be ordered</li>
                    <li><strong>Substance abuse screening:</strong> Required evaluation</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Second Zero Tolerance Offense:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Classification:</strong> Misdemeanor criminal offense</li>
                    <li><strong>Jail time:</strong> Up to 93 days</li>
                    <li><strong>Fine:</strong> Up to $500</li>
                    <li><strong>License suspension:</strong> 90 days, plus restrictions</li>
                    <li><strong>Criminal record:</strong> Permanent misdemeanor conviction</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>If BAC is 0.08% or higher (even if under 21):</strong> You'll be charged with regular OWI (Operating While Intoxicated), which is a misdemeanor with much harsher penalties including up to 93 days in jail, up to $500 fine, 180-day license suspension, possible vehicle immobilization, and mandatory alcohol treatment.</p>

                <h3>Zero Tolerance Impact on GVSU Students: Beyond Legal Penalties</h3>
                <p>The legal penalties are just the beginning. Zero Tolerance violations create cascading consequences that can derail your entire GVSU experience:</p>

                <h4>Academic and Enrollment Consequences</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>GVSU Student Conduct proceedings:</strong> Alcohol violations trigger university disciplinary action separate from criminal court</li>
                    <li><strong>Housing probation or loss:</strong> GVSU can revoke your campus housing for alcohol violations</li>
                    <li><strong>Parking privileges revoked:</strong> Loss of campus parking pass after DUI/Zero Tolerance conviction</li>
                    <li><strong>Study abroad disqualification:</strong> Many international programs reject students with alcohol-related driving offenses</li>
                    <li><strong>Leadership positions lost:</strong> Student organization officers, RAs, and ambassadors may be removed</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Scholarship and Financial Aid Risks</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Merit scholarships:</strong> Presidential Scholarship, Dean's Scholarship, and departmental funding often require "good standing" - disciplinary probation can trigger loss</li>
                    <li><strong>Athletic scholarships:</strong> GVSU athletes face immediate team suspension and potential scholarship revocation</li>
                    <li><strong>Private scholarships:</strong> External scholarships from churches, community organizations, or private donors may have conduct clauses</li>
                    <li><strong>Financial aid suspension:</strong> If GVSU suspends you from housing or enrollment, financial aid can be affected</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Professional Program and Career Impacts</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nursing students:</strong> Clinical placements require transportation - license suspension prevents clinical rotation completion; background checks may reveal conviction</li>
                    <li><strong>Education majors:</strong> Student teaching requires reliable transportation to placements; Michigan teaching certification reviews criminal history including alcohol offenses</li>
                    <li><strong>Business majors (Seidman College):</strong> Internships often require driving; many employers conduct background checks</li>
                    <li><strong>Engineering and health sciences:</strong> Co-op placements and internships may be inaccessible without a valid license</li>
                    <li><strong>Graduate school applications:</strong> Law schools, medical schools, and other graduate programs ask about criminal history including alcohol offenses</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Practical Transportation Consequences</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Getting to Allendale campus:</strong> Limited public transportation options make license suspension devastating</li>
                    <li><strong>Internships and jobs:</strong> Off-campus work and internships become impossible without transportation</li>
                    <li><strong>Clinical/field placements:</strong> Professional programs require off-campus placements unreachable without driving</li>
                    <li><strong>Insurance costs:</strong> Auto insurance rates skyrocket after alcohol-related driving offenses - often unaffordable for students</li>
                    <li><strong>Future employment:</strong> Many employers conduct driving record checks - DUI/Zero Tolerance violations remain visible for years</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Defenses to Zero Tolerance Charges</h3>
                <p>Just because you were arrested doesn't mean you're automatically guilty. Common defenses include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Improper stop:</strong> Police must have reasonable suspicion to stop your vehicle - if the stop was illegal, evidence may be suppressed</li>
                    <li><strong>Faulty breath test:</strong> Breathalyzer machines require proper calibration and maintenance - testing errors are common</li>
                    <li><strong>Improper testing procedures:</strong> Police must follow specific protocols when administering tests</li>
                    <li><strong>Rising BAC defense:</strong> Your BAC may have been below 0.02% while driving but rose by the time of testing</li>
                    <li><strong>Mouth alcohol contamination:</strong> Mouthwash, breath spray, or GERD can cause false high readings</li>
                    <li><strong>Medical conditions:</strong> Diabetes, hypoglycemia, and other conditions can affect test results</li>
                    <li><strong>No actual physical control:</strong> Were you actually operating the vehicle or just sitting in a parked car?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What GVSU Students Should Do After a Zero Tolerance Arrest</h3>

                <p><strong>Immediate actions:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Do NOT refuse the breath test:</strong> Refusal results in automatic 1-year license suspension (worse than Zero Tolerance penalties)</li>
                    <li><strong>Be polite and cooperative physically, but remain silent about questions:</strong> Say "I want to speak with an attorney before answering questions"</li>
                    <li><strong>Document everything:</strong> What you ate/drank, when, how much; where you were; why you were driving; any medical conditions</li>
                    <li><strong>Save evidence:</strong> Receipts from restaurants/bars, witnesses present, timeline of events</li>
                    <li><strong>Contact an attorney immediately:</strong> Call (616) 227-3303 for a free consultation</li>
                    <li><strong>Do NOT post on social media:</strong> Prosecutors review social media - photos from parties can be used as evidence</li>
                    <li><strong>Attend all court dates:</strong> Missing court results in a warrant and additional criminal charges</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Do NOT:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Admit to drinking without first consulting an attorney</li>
                    <li>Try to explain yourself to police without legal representation</li>
                    <li>Assume a first offense "isn't a big deal" - it can destroy your GVSU career</li>
                    <li>Wait to hire an attorney - early intervention is critical</li>
                    <li>Talk to GVSU administrators without consulting your attorney first</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Domestic Violence Charges</h3>
                <p>College dating relationships can become volatile, especially when alcohol is involved. <a href="/domestic-violence-defense.html">Domestic violence charges</a> at GVSU often arise from:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Arguments between dating partners in residence halls</li>
                    <li>Physical altercations at parties or bars</li>
                    <li>Roommate conflicts that escalate to physical contact</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>GVSU students face unique domestic violence consequences:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Immediate removal from residence halls (even if you're the victim)</li>
                    <li>No-contact orders preventing attendance at shared classes</li>
                    <li>GVSU Title IX investigation running parallel to criminal case</li>
                    <li>Potential suspension even before criminal case is resolved</li>
                    <li>Education majors cannot complete student teaching with DV convictions</li>
                    <li>Nursing students may be removed from clinical rotations</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Disorderly Conduct and Related Charges</h3>
                <p>Common "party charges" for GVSU students include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Disorderly conduct:</strong> Fighting, loud behavior, refusing to leave when asked</li>
                    <li><strong>Trespassing:</strong> Refusing to leave a party or property when asked by police</li>
                    <li><strong>Open intoxicant:</strong> Walking around with open alcohol containers</li>
                    <li><strong>Noise violations:</strong> Particularly in Allendale residential areas near campus</li>
                </ul>

                <p>While these seem minor, they create criminal records and can trigger GVSU disciplinary proceedings.</p>

                <h2>How Criminal Charges Affect Your Academic Future at GVSU</h2>

                <h3>Enrollment Status and Academic Standing</h3>
                <p>Criminal charges can directly affect your ability to remain enrolled at GVSU:</p>

                <p><strong>Summary Suspension:</strong> For serious offenses, GVSU can immediately suspend you before any hearing takes place. You'll be barred from campus, unable to attend classes, and may lose housing. This can cause you to fail courses and lose entire semesters.</p>

                <p><strong>Regular Suspension or Expulsion:</strong> After a Student Code hearing, GVSU can suspend you for a semester, a year, or permanently expel you. A notation on your transcript makes it extremely difficult to transfer to another university.</p>

                <p><strong>Housing Loss:</strong> Even without suspension, GVSU can revoke your housing assignment. With 6,000+ on-campus beds, housing violations are taken seriously. If you're removed from housing mid-semester, finding alternative housing in Allendale is difficult and expensive.</p>

                <h3>Scholarship and Financial Aid Impacts</h3>

                <p><strong>Federal Financial Aid (FAFSA):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Alcohol charges (MIP):</strong> Generally do NOT affect federal aid eligibility</li>
                    <li><strong>Drug convictions:</strong> WILL affect eligibility - you must report drug convictions on FAFSA</li>
                    <li>Loss of eligibility can be temporary or permanent depending on the offense</li>
                    <li>Eligibility can sometimes be regained by completing approved drug rehabilitation programs</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>GVSU Institutional Scholarships:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Merit scholarships often have conduct requirements</li>
                    <li>Departmental scholarships may be revoked for criminal conduct</li>
                    <li>Presidential scholarships and honors college funding typically require good conduct standing</li>
                    <li>Once lost, scholarships are usually not reinstated even if charges are later dismissed</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Athletic Scholarships:</strong> GVSU is Division II with significant athletic programs. Student-athletes face additional consequences including team suspension, loss of playing time, and potential scholarship revocation.</p>

                <p><strong>External Scholarships:</strong> Private scholarships, church scholarships, and community organization funding often have strict conduct requirements. Criminal convictions may trigger immediate loss of funding.</p>

                <h3>Professional Program Concerns at GVSU</h3>

                <p>GVSU offers numerous professional programs where criminal records can end your career before it starts:</p>

                <h4>Kirkhof College of Nursing (Pew Campus)</h4>
                <p>Nursing students face the strictest requirements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Clinical placements:</strong> Hospitals and healthcare facilities conduct background checks. Any criminal record can disqualify you from placements, making it impossible to complete your degree</li>
                    <li><strong>Michigan nursing license:</strong> The Michigan Board of Nursing reviews criminal history. Drug convictions, theft, assault, and crimes of dishonesty can result in license denial</li>
                    <li><strong>Program dismissal:</strong> GVSU nursing program may dismiss students with criminal charges even before conviction</li>
                    <li><strong>Federal background checks:</strong> Many healthcare facilities require FBI background checks for employment</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>College of Education (Pew Campus)</h4>
                <p>Future teachers must pass rigorous background screening:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Student teaching placements:</strong> K-12 schools require background checks. Criminal records prevent placement, making degree completion impossible</li>
                    <li><strong>Michigan teaching certificate:</strong> State certification requires disclosure of all criminal convictions. Many convictions result in automatic denial</li>
                    <li><strong>Ongoing disclosure requirements:</strong> Even after certification, teachers must report arrests, and licenses can be revoked</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>School of Social Work</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Field placements require background checks</li>
                    <li>State licensing (LMSW, LCSW) considers criminal history</li>
                    <li>Many social service agencies cannot hire people with certain convictions</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Seidman College of Business</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Accounting majors seeking CPA licensure must disclose criminal history</li>
                    <li>Finance positions require background checks - theft and fraud convictions are disqualifying</li>
                    <li>Internships at major firms require clean records</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Pre-Professional Programs (Pre-Med, Pre-Law, Pre-Pharmacy)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Medical school:</strong> Applications require criminal history disclosure; admissions committees scrutinize any criminal record</li>
                    <li><strong>Law school:</strong> Character and fitness reviews before bar admission - some convictions prevent bar licensure entirely</li>
                    <li><strong>Pharmacy school:</strong> DEA background checks required; drug convictions prevent licensure</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Protecting Your Financial Aid and Scholarships</h2>

                <p>Understanding how criminal charges affect your funding is critical. Here's what every GVSU student needs to know:</p>

                <h3>Federal Financial Aid (Pell Grants, Student Loans)</h3>
                <p>The FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) asks about drug convictions. Specifically:</p>

                <p><strong>Question 23 asks:</strong> "Have you been convicted of possessing or selling illegal drugs for an offense that occurred while you were receiving federal student aid?"</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>If you answer "yes," your eligibility may be suspended</li>
                    <li><strong>Alcohol offenses (MIP, fake ID, OWI) do NOT affect federal aid eligibility</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Drug convictions (marijuana, cocaine, pills, etc.) DO affect eligibility</strong></li>
                    <li>The period of ineligibility depends on whether it was possession or sale, and whether it's a first or repeat offense</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Regaining eligibility after drug conviction:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Complete an approved drug rehabilitation program</li>
                    <li>Pass two unannounced drug tests administered by an approved program</li>
                    <li>Or wait until the ineligibility period ends</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Critical timing issue:</strong> If you're convicted of a drug offense WHILE receiving federal aid (during the semester), you must report it and your aid may be immediately suspended. This can leave you unable to pay tuition mid-semester.</p>

                <h3>GVSU Institutional Scholarships</h3>
                <p>These are governed by GVSU's policies and vary by scholarship:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Merit scholarships:</strong> Presidential Scholarship, Dean's Scholarship, etc. - typically require "good standing" with the university</li>
                    <li><strong>Good standing definition:</strong> Not on academic or disciplinary probation</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk:</strong> If GVSU takes disciplinary action (probation, suspension), you may lose merit scholarships immediately</li>
                    <li><strong>Departmental scholarships:</strong> Awarded by specific colleges/departments - often have explicit conduct requirements</li>
                    <li><strong>Professional program scholarships:</strong> Nursing, education, and business scholarships often require clean disciplinary records</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Important: Scholarships lost due to disciplinary action are rarely reinstated, even if criminal charges are dismissed.</strong> It's critical to prevent GVSU disciplinary findings, not just fight the criminal case.</p>

                <h3>Athletic Scholarships and NCAA Eligibility</h3>
                <p>GVSU competes in NCAA Division II with 18 varsity sports. Student-athletes face additional layers of consequences:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Team suspension:</strong> Coaches often suspend athletes immediately upon arrest, regardless of guilt</li>
                    <li><strong>Loss of playing time:</strong> Can affect athletic career development and professional prospects</li>
                    <li><strong>NCAA drug testing:</strong> Drug convictions may trigger increased testing</li>
                    <li><strong>Scholarship review:</strong> Athletic scholarships are renewed annually - arrests can lead to non-renewal</li>
                    <li><strong>Transfer difficulties:</strong> Other schools may refuse to accept transfers with disciplinary issues</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>International Student Immigration Consequences</h2>

                <p>GVSU enrolls students from dozens of countries. International students on F-1 visas face unique and severe consequences from criminal charges:</p>

                <h3>Visa Status Risks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Criminal convictions can result in visa revocation</strong></li>
                    <li>Drug convictions are particularly serious - can trigger deportation proceedings</li>
                    <li>Crimes of moral turpitude (theft, fraud, assault) can make you inadmissible to the U.S.</li>
                    <li>Even a conviction that doesn't result in jail time can affect visa status</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Maintaining Legal Status</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you're suspended from GVSU, you lose F-1 status (no longer enrolled full-time)</li>
                    <li>Loss of F-1 status requires you to leave the U.S. immediately</li>
                    <li>You cannot transfer to another university while deportation proceedings are pending</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Re-Entry and Future Immigration</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Criminal convictions can prevent re-entry to the U.S. for travel, education, or future employment</li>
                    <li>H-1B visa applications (for post-graduation work) require criminal background disclosure</li>
                    <li>Green card applications are denied for many criminal convictions</li>
                    <li>Some convictions create permanent inadmissibility - you can never return to the U.S.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>International students must consult with an immigration attorney in addition to a criminal defense attorney.</strong> The criminal case strategy must account for immigration consequences.</p>

                <h2>Athletic Eligibility and NCAA Rules</h2>

                <p>GVSU's Lakers compete in the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (GLIAC) with strong programs in football, basketball, track and field, and many other sports. Student-athletes have additional concerns beyond typical students:</p>

                <h3>Immediate Consequences</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Team suspension:</strong> Most coaches have zero-tolerance policies for arrests - you may be immediately suspended from the team</li>
                    <li><strong>Loss of competition eligibility:</strong> Cannot compete in games/meets while suspended</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice restrictions:</strong> May be barred from team facilities and practices</li>
                    <li><strong>Training table and team benefits:</strong> May lose access to athletic training, nutrition, and medical services</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Scholarship Implications</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Athletic scholarships are renewed annually - not guaranteed for all four years</li>
                    <li>Coaches can choose not to renew scholarships after disciplinary issues</li>
                    <li>Athletic aid may be immediately suspended pending case resolution</li>
                    <li>Even if criminal charges are dismissed, the coach may not reinstate you to the team</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>NCAA Drug Testing and Violations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>NCAA maintains list of banned substances</li>
                    <li>Positive drug test = automatic suspension (duration varies by substance)</li>
                    <li>Criminal drug conviction may trigger immediate NCAA ineligibility</li>
                    <li>Some NCAA suspensions can carry over even if you transfer schools</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Professional Sports Aspirations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pro scouts review disciplinary history - arrests affect draft stock and recruiting</li>
                    <li>Character concerns from college incidents follow you to professional combines and interviews</li>
                    <li>Criminal records can prevent international play (work visas denied)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Graduate School Applications and Career Impact</h2>

                <p>Most GVSU students plan to continue their education or enter professional careers after graduation. Criminal records create significant barriers:</p>

                <h3>Graduate School Admissions</h3>
                <p>Almost all graduate programs require disclosure of criminal history on applications:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Law school:</strong> Detailed criminal history required; state bars conduct separate "character and fitness" investigations before allowing you to practice law</li>
                    <li><strong>Medical school:</strong> Criminal history questions on applications; convictions for violence, drugs, or dishonesty heavily scrutinized</li>
                    <li><strong>MBA programs:</strong> Business schools ask about criminal history; top programs may reject applicants with convictions</li>
                    <li><strong>PhD programs:</strong> Academic programs review conduct for teaching assistant and research positions</li>
                    <li><strong>Education programs:</strong> Master's in education requires background checks for field placements</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Disclosure requirements:</strong> Most applications ask: "Have you ever been convicted of a crime?" Some ask about arrests regardless of outcome. Lying on applications can result in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Automatic rejection if discovered</li>
                    <li>Expulsion if admitted and later discovered</li>
                    <li>Degree revocation</li>
                    <li>Professional license denial for dishonesty</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Employment Background Checks</h3>
                <p>The majority of employers conduct criminal background checks:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Corporate positions:</strong> Finance, accounting, management roles require clean records</li>
                    <li><strong>Government jobs:</strong> Security clearances impossible with many convictions</li>
                    <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Hospitals, clinics, nursing homes conduct FBI background checks</li>
                    <li><strong>Education:</strong> Teaching positions require state background checks</li>
                    <li><strong>Licensed professions:</strong> Nursing, pharmacy, law, psychology, social work, real estate all review criminal history</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Professional Licensing Boards</h3>
                <p>Many GVSU graduates pursue licensed professions. State licensing boards review criminal history and can deny licenses for convictions, including:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Michigan Board of Nursing:</strong> Denies licenses for drug offenses, theft, patient abuse, crimes of dishonesty</li>
                    <li><strong>Michigan Department of Education:</strong> Teaching certificates denied for felonies, some misdemeanors, crimes involving minors</li>
                    <li><strong>Michigan Board of Pharmacy:</strong> Drug convictions prevent licensure</li>
                    <li><strong>State Bar of Michigan:</strong> Character and fitness review before bar admission - many convictions result in denial</li>
                    <li><strong>Board of Social Work:</strong> Reviews criminal history for LMSW and LCSW licensure</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Timeline matters:</strong> Even if a licensing board eventually approves you, delays of months or years can derail your career launch. You may graduate but be unable to work in your field while waiting for license approval.</p>

                <h2>What to Do Immediately After Being Arrested as a GVSU Student</h2>

                <p>If you've been arrested, the next 24-48 hours are critical. Here's exactly what to do:</p>

                <h3>1. Exercise Your Right to Remain Silent</h3>
                <p><strong>Do NOT talk to the police without an attorney present.</strong> This is the single most important thing you can do to protect yourself.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Police may tell you "this will go easier if you just explain what happened" - this is not true</li>
                    <li>Everything you say can and will be used against you</li>
                    <li>You cannot talk your way out of an arrest</li>
                    <li>Politely say: "I want to remain silent and I want to speak with an attorney"</li>
                    <li>Do not make statements, do not answer questions, do not try to explain</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Be polite but firm:</strong> You can invoke your rights respectfully. Don't be rude or combative with police, but don't answer questions either.</p>

                <h3>2. Do NOT Post on Social Media</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not post about the arrest on Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter, or Facebook</li>
                    <li>Do not respond to friends' questions or comments about what happened</li>
                    <li>Prosecutors regularly review social media - anything you post can be used as evidence</li>
                    <li>Even "private" messages and stories can be subpoenaed</li>
                    <li><strong>Tell your friends not to post about it either</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Preserve Evidence</h3>
                <p>Immediately document anything that might help your defense:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Witness information:</strong> Names and phone numbers of anyone who saw what happened</li>
                    <li><strong>Photos/videos:</strong> Save any photos or videos from the incident (but don't share them publicly)</li>
                    <li><strong>Text messages:</strong> Screenshot relevant conversations (but don't delete anything)</li>
                    <li><strong>Receipts or records:</strong> Anything showing where you were, what you were doing, etc.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Contact a Criminal Defense Attorney Immediately</h3>
                <p>Do not wait. Do not try to handle this yourself. Do not rely on a public defender (you likely won't qualify anyway).</p>

                <p><strong>Call us at (616) 227-3303 for a free, confidential consultation.</strong></p>

                <p>We offer:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Free initial consultations to assess your case</li>
                    <li>Payment plans for students with limited funds</li>
                    <li>Experience with both 58th District Court (Allendale) and 61st District Court (Grand Rapids)</li>
                    <li>Understanding of GVSU's Student Code process</li>
                    <li>Knowledge of professional program requirements and licensing concerns</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Do NOT Talk to GVSU Administrators Without Legal Advice</h3>
                <p>If GVSU's Office of Student Conduct contacts you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not immediately agree to meet with them</li>
                    <li>Do not make statements about what happened</li>
                    <li>You have the right to consult with an attorney before responding</li>
                    <li>What you tell GVSU can be used in your criminal case</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>For professional programs requiring immediate reporting:</strong> Consult with an attorney about how to report in a way that protects your rights.</p>

                <h3>6. Attend All Court Dates</h3>
                <p>Missing a court appearance will result in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A warrant for your arrest</li>
                    <li>Additional charges (failure to appear)</li>
                    <li>Loss of bond (if you posted bail)</li>
                    <li>Immediate GVSU disciplinary action</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Your attorney will appear with you and handle court proceedings. Never go to court alone.</p>

                <h3>7. Do NOT Miss Classes</h3>
                <p>It's tempting to skip classes because of stress, anxiety, or court appearances. Don't.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintain your academic standing - you may need good grades more than ever</li>
                    <li>Sudden academic decline can trigger questions from advisors</li>
                    <li>If you're suspended later, strong academic performance helps with appeals</li>
                    <li>Your attorney can help schedule court dates around your class schedule</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>8. Decide Whether to Tell Your Parents</h3>
                <p>This is a personal decision. Consider:</p>

                <p><strong>Reasons to tell them:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You may need financial help for attorney fees</li>
                    <li>They may find out anyway (especially if you live at home during breaks)</li>
                    <li>Court mail may be sent to your permanent address</li>
                    <li>Family support can help with stress</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Reasons to wait:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You're an adult - you have the right to handle this independently</li>
                    <li>We can help resolve many cases quickly without parental involvement</li>
                    <li>You can tell them after you have an attorney and a plan</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you're worried about parental notification, discuss confidentiality strategies with your attorney during your initial consultation.</p>

                <h2>GVSU Courts and Jurisdiction</h2>

                <h3>58th District Court - Hudsonville Division (Allendale Campus Cases)</h3>
                <p><strong>Address:</strong> 3100 Port Sheldon Street, Hudsonville, MI 49426</p>

                <p><strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> All misdemeanor cases arising in Ottawa County, including the Allendale campus area. This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>MIP arrests at off-campus parties</li>
                    <li>Fake ID offenses at Allendale bars</li>
                    <li>Disorderly conduct and noise violations</li>
                    <li>Marijuana possession (under 21)</li>
                    <li>Open intoxicant and public intoxication</li>
                    <li>Retail fraud at Allendale stores</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Felony cases</strong> from Allendale start in 58th District Court for arraignment and preliminary examination, then move to 20th Circuit Court in Grand Haven for trial.</p>

                <p><strong>What to expect:</strong> The 58th District Court processes hundreds of GVSU student cases annually. Judges and prosecutors are familiar with student situations but still take charges seriously. Having local counsel who appears regularly in this court is a significant advantage.</p>

                <h3>61st District Court - Grand Rapids (Pew Campus Cases)</h3>
                <p><strong>Address:</strong> 180 Ottawa Ave NW, Grand Rapids, MI 49503</p>

                <p><strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> All misdemeanor cases arising in the City of Grand Rapids and portions of Kent County, including the Pew Campus area. This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Downtown Grand Rapids bar incidents</li>
                    <li>Fake ID offenses at downtown establishments</li>
                    <li>Disorderly conduct and fighting</li>
                    <li>Drug possession arrests near Pew Campus</li>
                    <li>DUI/OWI on downtown streets</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Felony cases</strong> from Grand Rapids start in 61st District Court, then move to 17th Circuit Court (also in Grand Rapids) for trial.</p>

                <p><strong>What to expect:</strong> 61st District Court is a high-volume urban court. The environment is more formal and fast-paced than Hudsonville. Professional programs at Pew Campus mean many defendants are nursing, education, or health sciences students with significant licensing concerns.</p>

                <h3>Circuit Courts (Felony Cases)</h3>

                <h3>GVSU Police Department</h3>
                <p>GVSU has its own police department with full arrest authority. GVSU Police officers can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Arrest students on campus or in adjacent areas</li>
                    <li>File criminal charges in district court</li>
                    <li>Refer cases to Student Conduct for disciplinary action</li>
                    <li>Coordinate with Ottawa County Sheriff and Grand Rapids Police</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Important: GVSU Police arrests typically trigger BOTH criminal prosecution AND university disciplinary proceedings.</strong> This is one of the most challenging aspects of on-campus arrests.</p>

                <h3>Confidentiality You Can Trust</h3>
                <p>We understand that confidentiality is critical for college students. Many students fear:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Parents finding out</li>
                    <li>Friends and classmates learning about the arrest</li>
                    <li>GVSU administrators discovering details</li>
                    <li>Future employers or schools learning about charges</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Attorney-client privilege protects our conversations. What you tell us stays confidential. We can help you navigate this situation discreetly while protecting your privacy.</p>

                </ul>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions - GVSU Student Criminal Defense</h2>

                <h3>Will GVSU find out about my criminal charges?</h3>
                <p>GVSU may find out about criminal charges through several channels:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the arrest occurred on campus (GVSU Police report to Student Code Office)</li>
                    <li>If you're required to report to your academic program (especially nursing, education, social work)</li>
                    <li>If you miss classes for court appearances</li>
                    <li>If a conviction affects your financial aid</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The university does not automatically receive notifications of off-campus arrests by local police, but they may learn about it through other means.</p>

                <h3>Can I lose my financial aid because of an MIP charge?</h3>
                <p>For alcohol-related charges like MIP, you typically will NOT lose federal financial aid. However:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Drug convictions CAN affect your FAFSA eligibility</li>
                    <li>GVSU scholarships may have conduct requirements that could be affected by any criminal conviction</li>
                    <li>Merit scholarships, departmental scholarships, and athletic scholarships all have conduct clauses that vary by program</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What's the difference between 58th District Court and 61st District Court for GVSU students?</h3>
                <p>If you're arrested on or near the Allendale campus, your case will be heard in 58th District Court (Hudsonville Division). If you're arrested at or near the Pew Campus in downtown Grand Rapids, your case goes to 61st District Court.</p>

                <p>The two courts have different judges, procedures, and approaches to student cases. This dual-campus situation is unique to GVSU students and requires an attorney familiar with both court systems.</p>

                <h3>Will my parents find out about my arrest?</h3>
                <p>If you are 18 or older, the police and courts will not automatically notify your parents. However, parents may find out if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You list them as an emergency contact</li>
                    <li>Court mail is sent to your permanent home address</li>
                    <li>You need their financial help for an attorney or fines</li>
                    <li>GVSU notifies them (which they may do for serious conduct violations)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you want to keep this confidential, discuss strategies with your attorney immediately.</p>

                <h3>How will this affect my nursing/education/social work program at GVSU?</h3>
                <p>Professional programs at GVSU (especially those at Pew Campus) have strict conduct requirements because of state licensing boards:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nursing students with drug or theft convictions may be denied state licensure</li>
                    <li>Education students must pass background checks for student teaching placements and Michigan teaching certification</li>
                    <li>Social work students need field placements that require background checks</li>
                </ul>

                <p>It's critical to address criminal charges immediately to protect your ability to continue in these programs.</p>

                <h3>Can I get kicked out of GVSU for a criminal charge?</h3>
                <p>Yes. GVSU can suspend or expel students for criminal conduct through their Student Code of Conduct process, which is separate from criminal court. Summary suspension (immediate removal from campus) is possible for serious offenses.</p>

                <p>Even off-campus arrests can trigger university disciplinary action. You may face both criminal court proceedings and a separate GVSU Student Code hearing, which requires a coordinated defense strategy to protect both your legal rights and your enrollment status.</p>

                <h3>What should I do immediately after being arrested as a GVSU student?</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Do not talk to police without an attorney (invoke your right to remain silent politely)</li>
                    <li>Do not post about the arrest on social media</li>
                    <li>Save any evidence (text messages, photos, witness names)</li>
                    <li>Contact a criminal defense attorney immediately</li>
                    <li>Do not speak with GVSU administrators without first consulting an attorney</li>
                    <li>Attend all court dates</li>
                    <li>Consider whether you need to notify your academic program (some require immediate reporting)</li>
                    <li>Do not miss classes or exams because of stress - maintain your academic standing</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>How much does a student defense attorney cost?</h3>
                <p>We understand that GVSU students often have limited funds. We offer:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Free initial consultations to discuss your case</li>
                    <li>Fees that vary based on the complexity of your charges and court location</li>
                    <li>Payment plans for students</li>
                    <li>Work with parents to arrange affordable representation</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The cost of NOT hiring an attorney - including lost scholarships, inability to complete your degree, or professional licensing problems - is far greater than the cost of experienced legal representation.</p>
