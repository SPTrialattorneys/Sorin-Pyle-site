                        <h4>📍 We Know Grandville's 61st District Court</h4>

                        <p>We've built professional relationships with the Kent County Prosecutor's Office over years of practice. While we're fierce advocates for our clients, prosecutors know we're prepared, reasonable, and ready to take cases to trial when necessary. This reputation helps us negotiate better outcomes and achieve more favorable resolutions.</p>

                        <h4>🏛️ Trial Experience in Kent County's 17th Circuit Court</h4>
                        <p>Felony cases in Grandville are tried in the 17th Circuit Court in downtown Grand Rapids.

This experience is invaluable during plea negotiations and trial preparation.</p>

                        <h4>🛍️ Defending Retail Fraud Cases from RiverTown Crossings</h4>
                        <p>RiverTown Crossings Mall is one of the largest shopping centers in West Michigan, and retail fraud (shoplifting) prosecutions are extremely common. We understand how loss prevention departments operate, how evidence is collected, and how to challenge retail fraud charges. We've successfully defended numerous clients charged with shoplifting at RiverTown.</p>

                <h2>Common Criminal Charges in Grandville, MI</h2>

                <p>We defend Grandville residents against all types of criminal charges, including:</p>

                <div class="grid_2-col margin-bottom-lg">
                    <div>
                        <h3>Retail Fraud at RiverTown Crossings</h3>
                        <p>RiverTown Crossings Mall generates a high volume of retail fraud prosecutions. Stores like Macy's, JCPenney, Dick's Sporting Goods, Target, and others have aggressive loss prevention teams who pursue criminal charges even for first-time, low-value thefts. Retail fraud convictions create permanent criminal records that appear on background checks and can impact employment. We work to have these charges dismissed, negotiate civil settlements, or reduce charges to avoid theft convictions.</p>

                        <h3>DUI / OWI Charges</h3>
                        <p>Grandville police conduct frequent traffic stops and DUI enforcement along Chicago Drive (M-11), Wilson Avenue, I-196, and residential streets. DUI arrests often occur near bars and restaurants along the commercial corridors. If you've been arrested for drunk driving in Grandville, we can challenge breathalyzer results, field sobriety tests, and the legality of the traffic stop. <a href="/dui-defense.html">Learn more about our DUI defense services</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Domestic Violence</h3>
                        <p>Domestic violence arrests are common in suburban communities like Grandville. Police are required to make an arrest when called to a domestic disturbance, even if no injuries occurred and the alleged victim wants charges dropped. Kent County prosecutors pursue these cases aggressively. We defend against false accusations, mutual combat situations, and cases where you acted in self-defense. A domestic violence conviction carries serious consequences—loss of gun rights, potential jail time, and a permanent criminal record. <a href="/domestic-violence-defense.html">Learn more about domestic violence defense</a>.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Drug Charges</h3>
                        <p>Drug charges in Grandville typically arise from traffic stops, search warrants at residences, or investigations at retail establishments. Whether you're facing possession of marijuana (over legal limits), cocaine, methamphetamine, prescription drugs, or more serious charges like possession with intent to deliver, we provide aggressive defense. Many drug cases can be resolved through diversion programs, reduced charges, or outright dismissals when police violated your rights.</p>

                        <h3>Assault & Battery</h3>
                        <p>Assault charges in Grandville can arise from bar fights along Chicago Drive, neighborhood disputes, or altercations at RiverTown Crossings or other commercial areas. We defend clients by demonstrating self-defense, challenging witness credibility, and negotiating reduced charges. Assault convictions can result in jail time, probation, and a violent crime on your record.</p>

                        <h3>Traffic Offenses</h3>
                        <p>Reckless driving, driving while license suspended (DWLS), leaving the scene of an accident, and other serious traffic offenses can result in jail time, license suspension, and a criminal record. Grandville police actively enforce traffic laws on Chicago Drive, Wilson Avenue, and I-196. We help Grandville drivers protect their licenses and avoid criminal convictions.</p>

                        <h3>Organized Retail Theft</h3>
                        <p>With RiverTown Crossings as a major retail hub, prosecutors sometimes charge organized retail crime—allegations that defendants are part of organized shoplifting rings. These are serious felony charges that can result in prison time. We aggressively defend against these charges and challenge the evidence prosecutors use to allege organized criminal activity.</p>
                    </div>

                <h2>Grandville's 61st District Court</h2>

                <p>Court appearances in Grandville cases are held at the 61st District Court courthouse in Grand Rapids. If you receive a court notice, it will specify your courtroom and appearance date. <strong>Never miss a court date</strong>—this results in a bench warrant for your arrest. If you've missed a court date, call us immediately at <strong>(616) 227-3303</strong> to resolve the warrant before you're arrested.</p>

                <hr class="hr-divider">

                <h2>Protecting Grandville Residents' Rights</h2>

                <p>When you're charged with a crime in Grandville, you're facing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Jail time or prison sentences</li>
                    <li>Fines and court costs (often thousands of dollars)</li>
                    <li>Probation with strict conditions (drug testing, no alcohol, community service)</li>
                    <li>A permanent criminal record visible on background checks</li>
                    <li>Loss of employment and difficulty finding new jobs</li>
                    <li>Difficulty finding housing (landlords deny applicants with criminal records)</li>
                    <li>Immigration consequences (for non-citizens)</li>
                    <li>Loss of gun rights (for domestic violence and felony convictions)</li>
                    <li>Professional license suspensions (for medical, legal, and other licensed professionals)</li>
                    <li>Retail bans from RiverTown Crossings and other malls (for retail fraud convictions)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Our job is to protect you from these consequences. We investigate every case thoroughly, challenge the prosecution's evidence, and fight for dismissals, not guilty verdicts, or reduced charges. When trial isn't the best option, we negotiate aggressively for the most favorable outcome possible.</p>

                <h2>What to Do If You're Arrested in Grandville</h2>

                <p>If Grandville police or Kent County Sheriff's deputies arrest you, follow these steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Remain silent.</strong> Do NOT talk to police without a lawyer present. Anything you say WILL be used against you. Invoke your right to remain silent and request an attorney immediately.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not consent to searches.</strong> Police may ask to search your car, phone, or home. Politely decline and say you do not consent to searches. Do not physically resist, but make it clear you are not giving permission.</li>
                    <li><strong>For retail fraud arrests:</strong> Do not make statements to loss prevention or police. Many people try to explain or apologize, thinking it will help—it won't. These statements will be used against you in court.</li>
                    <li><strong>Call an attorney immediately.</strong> The sooner we start working on your case, the better your outcome. Call us at <strong>(616) 227-3303</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not post about your case on social media.</strong> Prosecutors will review your Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and other accounts looking for evidence against you. Anything you post can and will be used in court.</li>
                    <li><strong>Document everything.</strong> Write down what happened while it's fresh in your mind, including names of witnesses, photos of injuries or the scene, and any evidence supporting your defense.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not talk to the alleged victim (in domestic cases).</strong> If you're arrested for domestic violence, do NOT contact the alleged victim—this will result in additional charges for violating a no-contact order.</li>
                </ol>
