                        <h4>📍 We Know Kentwood's 61st District Court</h4>

                        <p>The 28th Street corridor is one of Michigan's largest retail districts, stretching through Kentwood with major shopping centers like Woodland Mall, RiverTown Crossings, and hundreds of businesses. We've defended countless retail fraud, theft, fraud, and commercial crime cases arising from this area and understand the prosecution strategies used for these charges.</p>

                        <h4>🚗 Aggressive DUI Enforcement Expertise</h4>
                        <p>Kentwood police conduct intensive DUI enforcement along 28th Street, East Beltline, Broadmoor Avenue, and major corridors.

                <h2>Common Criminal Charges in Kentwood, MI</h2>

                <p>We defend Kentwood residents against all types of criminal charges, including:</p>

                <div class="grid_2-col margin-bottom-lg">
                    <div>
                        <h3>Retail Fraud & Theft</h3>
                        <p>Kentwood leads West Michigan in retail fraud cases due to the 28th Street commercial corridor. Woodland Mall, RiverTown Crossings, Target, Meijer, Best Buy, and hundreds of other retailers aggressively pursue shoplifting charges. Many stores use sophisticated loss prevention teams, surveillance systems, and civil demand notices. Even first-time retail fraud can result in criminal convictions that follow you for life. We defend clients by challenging evidence, negotiating diversion programs, and fighting for dismissals.</p>

                        <h3>DUI / OWI in Kentwood</h3>
                        <p>Kentwood police conduct aggressive DUI enforcement along 28th Street (M-11), East Beltline (M-37), Broadmoor Avenue, and connecting roads. With heavy traffic flow and numerous restaurants and bars, DUI arrests spike during evenings and weekends. Kent County prosecutors are notoriously tough on drunk driving, but we know how to challenge breathalyzer results, field sobriety tests, and police procedures. <a href="/dui-defense.html">Learn more about our DUI defense services</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Fraud & White Collar Crimes</h3>
                        <p>The commercial nature of Kentwood results in frequent fraud charges—credit card fraud, identity theft, embezzlement, false pretenses, and uttering and publishing (bad checks). These charges often carry harsher penalties than simple theft and can destroy professional careers. We defend white collar crime cases aggressively.</p>

                        <h3>Drug Crimes</h3>
                        <p>Kentwood police and the Kent Area Narcotics Enforcement Team (KANET) actively investigate drug crimes throughout the city. From possession of marijuana, cocaine, or methamphetamine to possession with intent to deliver and conspiracy charges, drug offenses are prosecuted vigorously. Many cases involve illegal searches during traffic stops on 28th Street and surrounding areas. We challenge the evidence and fight for your rights.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Domestic Violence</h3>
                        <p>Domestic violence arrests are common throughout Kentwood's residential neighborhoods. Police respond to domestic calls daily, and Michigan law requires officers to arrest someone when they believe assault occurred. A domestic violence conviction means loss of gun rights, custody issues, and immigration consequences. We defend against false accusations, mutual combat situations, and exaggerated claims. <a href="/domestic-violence-defense.html">Learn more about domestic violence defense</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Assault & Violent Crimes</h3>
                        <p>From simple assault and battery to felonious assault and aggravated assault, Kentwood prosecutors charge violent crimes aggressively. Bar fights, disputes at businesses, parking lot altercations on 28th Street—these situations escalate quickly and result in serious charges. We defend by demonstrating self-defense, challenging witness credibility, and negotiating reduced charges.</p>

                        <h3>Traffic Offenses</h3>
                        <p>Reckless driving, driving while license suspended (DWLS), fleeing and eluding police, and leaving the scene of an accident are serious criminal offenses. With Kentwood's heavy traffic volume, traffic-related criminal charges are common. We help protect your license and avoid convictions.</p>

                        <h3>Gun Crimes</h3>
                        <p>Carrying a concealed weapon (CCW) without a permit, felon in possession of a firearm, and weapons charges are serious felonies in Michigan. Kentwood police actively investigate firearms offenses. If you're facing gun charges, you need experienced defense immediately.</p>

                <h2>Kentwood's 61st District Court - Kentwood Division</h2>

                <p>The 61st District Court - Kentwood Division is located at <strong>4740 Walma Avenue SE, Kentwood, MI 49512</strong>. This court handles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>All misdemeanor cases</strong> in Kentwood (DUI, domestic violence, assault, retail fraud, drug possession, etc.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Preliminary examinations</strong> for felony cases (before they're bound over to the 17th Circuit Court)</li>
                    <li><strong>Traffic violations</strong> and civil infractions</li>

                <p>This court is one of Kent County's busiest, handling thousands of cases annually from Kentwood's large population and high-traffic commercial areas. Judges and prosecutors move quickly through caseloads, and without experienced representation, you can easily get pressured into unfavorable plea deals.</p>

                <p><strong>Never miss a court date</strong>—this results in a bench warrant for your arrest. If you've missed a court date, call us immediately at <strong>(616) 227-3303</strong> to resolve the warrant before you're arrested.</p>

                <h2>28th Street Criminal Defense: Retail Fraud Capital</h2>

                <p>The 28th Street corridor is notorious for retail fraud cases. Major retailers employ sophisticated loss prevention strategies:</p>

                    <li><strong>Civil demand notices</strong> demanding payment in addition to criminal charges</li>

                    <li><strong>Aggressive prosecution</strong> with Kent County treating retail fraud seriously</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you're charged with retail fraud in Kentwood, you're facing potential jail time, fines, restitution to the store, and a theft conviction that will affect employment, housing, and professional licenses for life. We fight these charges aggressively and often negotiate dismissals or reduced charges for first-time offenders.</p>

                <hr class="hr-divider">

                <h2>What to Do If You're Arrested in Kentwood</h2>

                <p>If Kentwood police arrest you, follow these critical steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Invoke your right to remain silent.</strong> DO NOT talk to police without a lawyer present. Tell them, "I am invoking my right to remain silent, and I want to speak with an attorney."</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not consent to searches.</strong> Police may ask to search your car, phone, home, or belongings. Politely say, "I do not consent to any searches."</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not resist arrest.</strong> Even if the arrest is unjust, do not physically resist. Resisting arrest is an additional criminal charge.</li>
                    <li><strong>Call an attorney immediately.</strong> The sooner we start working on your case, the better your chances. Call us at <strong>(616) 227-3303</strong> as soon as you're released or have access to a phone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Document everything.</strong> Write down what happened, names of witnesses, officer badge numbers, and any evidence that supports your innocence. Take photos of injuries or property damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do NOT post on social media.</strong> Prosecutors will review your social media accounts looking for evidence against you.</li>
                </ol>
