The cost of NOT hiring an attorney - including lost scholarships, inability to complete your degree, or professional licensing problems - is far greater than the cost of experienced legal representation."

                <h2>Criminal Charges Can Destroy Your WMU Career Before It Even Starts</h2>
                <p>You worked hard to get into Western Michigan University. You're building toward a career in business, education, aviation, engineering, or one of WMU's many strong programs. You're living the college experience in Kalamazoo - maybe in off-campus housing near campus, hitting downtown bars on the weekends, or navigating the active party scene that comes with being at Michigan's second-largest university in our service area.</p>

                <p><strong>Then you get arrested. MIP at an off-campus party. Fake ID at a downtown bar. DUI driving home. Drug possession in your apartment. Domestic violence after an argument.</strong></p>

                <p>Suddenly, everything you've worked for is at risk:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your WMU degree</li>
                    <li>Your scholarships and financial aid</li>
                    <li>Your professional program (business, education, nursing, aviation)</li>
                    <li>Your graduate school plans</li>
                    <li>Your career prospects and job offers</li>
                    <li>Your entire future</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>You're scared. You're worried about your parents finding out. You're panicking about getting kicked out of school. You don't know what to do.</strong></p>

                <p>At Sorin & Pyle, we've helped hundreds of college students through exactly this situation. We don't judge. We don't lecture. We defend. Whether you were arrested in Kalamazoo's student neighborhoods, downtown bars, or anywhere in West Michigan, we know how to protect your rights AND your future at WMU.</p>

                <h2>Understanding WMU's Kalamazoo Enforcement Environment</h2>
                <p>Western Michigan University's 16,693 students make Kalamazoo a college town with active nightlife, off-campus housing, and - unfortunately for students - aggressive law enforcement targeting student behavior.</p>

                <h3>High-Volume Student Arrests</h3>
                <p>Kalamazoo has a reputation for high-volume enforcement in student neighborhoods and downtown areas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Off-campus housing enforcement:</strong> Student neighborhoods near campus are heavily patrolled, especially on weekend nights</li>
                    <li><strong>Downtown bar sweeps:</strong> Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety (KDPS) conducts regular ID checks at downtown bars frequented by WMU students</li>
                    <li><strong>Party patrols:</strong> Noise complaints and large parties result in mass MIP tickets</li>
                    <li><strong>DUI checkpoints:</strong> Frequent sobriety checkpoints on routes between campus and student housing areas</li>
                    <li><strong>Fake ID crackdowns:</strong> Bars and liquor stores work closely with police to prosecute fake ID cases</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>WMU Police Department Coordination</h3>
                <p>WMU has its own police department that works closely with Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>WMU Police patrol campus and adjacent areas</li>
                    <li>Can arrest students on or near campus</li>
                    <li>File criminal charges in 8th District Court</li>
                    <li>Refer cases to WMU Student Conduct for disciplinary action</li>
                    <li>Share information with KDPS for off-campus incidents</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Important: Arrests by WMU Police typically trigger BOTH criminal prosecution AND university disciplinary proceedings.</strong></p>

                <h3>Distance Is Not a Barrier to Quality Defense</h3>
                <p>Kalamazoo is approximately 50 miles from our Holland office. <strong>We regularly represent clients in Kalamazoo County courts.</strong> We understand that WMU represents a significant market with over 16,000 students, and we are committed to providing the same high-quality representation to WMU students as we do to students at universities closer to our office.</p>

                <p>We know the judges, prosecutors, and procedures in Kalamazoo's 8th District Court. We've handled hundreds of cases there. Distance does not affect the quality of representation you receive.</p>

                <h2>Understanding Dual Proceedings: Criminal Court vs. WMU Disciplinary Process</h2>
                <p>Here's what most WMU students don't realize: <strong>getting arrested doesn't just mean criminal court. You may also face a completely separate disciplinary process through WMU's Code of Honor.</strong></p>

                <p>This means you could be fighting on two fronts simultaneously:</p>

                <h3>Criminal Court Proceedings (8th District Court / 9th Circuit Court)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prosecuted by Kalamazoo County Prosecutor's Office</li>
                    <li>Constitutional rights apply (right to remain silent, right to attorney, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Burden of proof: "Beyond a reasonable doubt"</li>
                    <li>Potential outcomes: Conviction, plea deal, dismissal, diversion programs</li>
                    <li>Consequences: Jail time, fines, probation, permanent criminal record</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>WMU Code of Honor Proceedings</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conducted by WMU Office of Student Conduct</li>
                    <li>Lower burden of proof: "Preponderance of the evidence" (more likely than not)</li>
                    <li>Limited due process rights compared to criminal court</li>
                    <li>Potential outcomes: Warning, probation, suspension, expulsion</li>
                    <li>Consequences: Loss of campus housing (if applicable), removal from academic programs, notation on transcript, permanent expulsion</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Critical: WMU can discipline you even if you're found not guilty in criminal court.</strong> The university uses a lower standard of evidence. They can also take action for off-campus conduct if they believe it violates the Code of Honor.</p>

                <p>Additionally, some WMU programs require students to self-report arrests:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nursing students:</strong> Must report arrests to program directors</li>
                    <li><strong>Education majors:</strong> Required to disclose for field placements and student teaching</li>
                    <li><strong>Social work students:</strong> Must report for field placement background checks</li>
                    <li><strong>Aviation students:</strong> FAA background checks required for pilot certification</li>
                    <li><strong>Other professional programs:</strong> May have reporting requirements</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Failing to report when required can result in immediate dismissal from the program - even if the criminal charges are eventually dropped.</p>

                <h2>Common Criminal Charges for WMU Students</h2>

                <h3>Minor in Possession of Alcohol (MIP)</h3>
                <p>MIP is by far the most common charge for WMU students. Kalamazoo police issue hundreds of MIP tickets annually at off-campus parties, downtown bars, and student housing areas.</p>

                <p><strong>Michigan MIP Law (effective 2018):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>First offense:</strong> Civil infraction (not a criminal misdemeanor), fine up to $100</li>
                    <li><strong>Second offense:</strong> Misdemeanor, up to 30 days in jail, doubled fines</li>
                    <li><strong>Third offense:</strong> Misdemeanor, up to 60 days in jail, up to $500 fine</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Even though a first MIP is now a civil infraction, it still appears on background checks and can trigger WMU disciplinary action. Many scholarships have conduct requirements that may be violated by an MIP.</p>

                <p><strong>Common MIP scenarios for WMU students:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Off-campus house parties in student neighborhoods</li>
                    <li>Walking home from downtown Kalamazoo bars</li>
                    <li>Tailgating at WMU football games</li>
                    <li>Residence hall parties (for on-campus students)</li>
                    <li>Mass ticketing operations at large parties</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>DUI/OWI Charges - Significant Enforcement in Kalamazoo</h3>
                <p>WMU students face particularly high DUI/OWI enforcement in Kalamazoo. <a href="/dui-defense.html">DUI charges</a> are common for students ages 21-22 (and younger students with fake IDs) who drive after drinking.</p>

                <p><strong>Why DUI is especially common at WMU:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Off-campus housing:</strong> Many students live off-campus and drive to bars, parties, or campus</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited public transportation:</strong> Kalamazoo's public transit is limited late at night</li>
                    <li><strong>Sobriety checkpoints:</strong> Frequent DUI checkpoints on routes between campus and housing areas</li>
                    <li><strong>Downtown patrol:</strong> Heavy police presence in downtown Kalamazoo bar district</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Michigan's Zero Tolerance Law for drivers under 21:</strong> If you're under 21, you can be charged with OWI if your BAC is 0.02% or higher (basically any alcohol). This is far below the 0.08% standard for adults.</p>

                <p><strong>Consequences of OWI for WMU students:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Driver's license suspension (how will you get to campus, work, or internships?)</li>
                    <li>Jail time possible even for first offense</li>
                    <li>Criminal record affecting job applications and professional licensing</li>
                    <li>Insurance rates skyrocket</li>
                    <li>May trigger WMU disciplinary action</li>
                    <li>Aviation students: FAA pilot certification denied with DUI conviction</li>
                    <li>Education students: Teaching certification affected</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Fake ID Possession and Use</h3>
                <p>Using a fake ID to buy alcohol or get into downtown Kalamazoo bars is a misdemeanor in Michigan. Kalamazoo bars have gotten much more aggressive about prosecuting fake ID cases.</p>

                <p><strong>What happens:</strong> In the past, a bouncer might just confiscate your fake ID. Now, they often call police, who file criminal charges. You'll be arrested and charged with a misdemeanor that carries potential jail time.</p>

                <p><strong>Why this matters for WMU students:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fake ID conviction is a crime of dishonesty</li>
                    <li>Particularly damaging for students planning careers in business, education, law, or healthcare</li>
                    <li>Professional licensing boards view dishonesty offenses very seriously</li>
                    <li>CPA certification (accounting/business students) can be denied</li>
                    <li>Teaching certification denied for crimes of dishonesty</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Drug Possession Charges</h3>
                <p>Even though Michigan legalized recreational marijuana, <strong>it's still illegal for anyone under 21.</strong> WMU students can be charged with marijuana possession if found with any amount.</p>

                <p><strong>Marijuana charges for WMU students:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use or possession by person under 21: Civil infraction, $100 fine (first offense)</li>
                    <li>Second offense: Civil infraction, $500 fine</li>
                    <li>Can still trigger WMU discipline and affect federal financial aid</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Other drug charges (prescription pills, cocaine, MDMA, etc.):</strong> These are serious criminal charges that can result in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Immediate loss of federal financial aid eligibility (FAFSA question about drug convictions)</li>
                    <li>Suspension or expulsion from WMU</li>
                    <li>Permanent criminal record affecting professional licensing</li>
                    <li>Potential jail or prison time for delivery/distribution charges</li>
                </ul>

                <p>WMU students studying pharmacy, nursing, pre-med, aviation, or any professional field face career-ending consequences from drug convictions. State licensing boards and employers routinely deny opportunities to applicants with drug-related criminal records.</p>

                <h3>Domestic Violence Charges</h3>
                <p>College dating relationships can become volatile, especially when alcohol is involved. <a href="/domestic-violence-defense.html">Domestic violence charges</a> at WMU often arise from:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Arguments between dating partners in off-campus housing</li>
                    <li>Physical altercations at parties or downtown bars</li>
                    <li>Roommate conflicts that escalate to physical contact</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>WMU students face unique domestic violence consequences:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No-contact orders preventing attendance at shared classes</li>
                    <li>WMU Title IX investigation running parallel to criminal case</li>
                    <li>Potential suspension even before criminal case is resolved</li>
                    <li>Education majors cannot complete student teaching with DV convictions</li>
                    <li>Nursing students may be removed from clinical rotations</li>
                    <li>Business students face background check failures for corporate internships</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Disorderly Conduct and Party-Related Charges</h3>
                <p>Common "party charges" for WMU students include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Disorderly conduct:</strong> Fighting, loud behavior, refusing to leave when asked</li>
                    <li><strong>Trespassing:</strong> Refusing to leave a party or property when asked by police</li>
                    <li><strong>Open intoxicant:</strong> Walking around with open alcohol containers</li>
                    <li><strong>Noise violations:</strong> Particularly in off-campus student housing areas</li>
                </ul>

                <p>While these seem minor, they create criminal records and can trigger WMU disciplinary proceedings.</p>

                <h2>How Criminal Charges Affect Your Academic Future at WMU</h2>

                <h3>Enrollment Status and Academic Standing</h3>
                <p>Criminal charges can directly affect your ability to remain enrolled at WMU:</p>

                <p><strong>Interim Suspension:</strong> For serious offenses, WMU can immediately suspend you before any hearing takes place. You'll be barred from campus, unable to attend classes, and may lose housing. This can cause you to fail courses and lose entire semesters.</p>

                <p><strong>Regular Suspension or Expulsion:</strong> After a Code of Honor hearing, WMU can suspend you for a semester, a year, or permanently expel you. A notation on your transcript makes it extremely difficult to transfer to another university.</p>

                <h3>Professional Program Concerns at WMU</h3>

                <h4>Haworth College of Business</h4>
                <p>WMU's business programs are well-regarded, but criminal records can destroy business career prospects:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Accounting majors seeking CPA licensure:</strong> Must disclose criminal history; dishonesty offenses (fake IDs, theft) can prevent CPA certification</li>
                    <li><strong>Finance positions:</strong> Corporate finance jobs require extensive background checks - theft and fraud convictions are disqualifying</li>
                    <li><strong>Internships at major firms:</strong> Big 4 accounting, major corporations all require clean records</li>
                    <li><strong>Management careers:</strong> Leadership positions require trust - criminal records raise red flags</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>College of Education and Human Development</h4>
                <p>Future teachers must pass rigorous background screening:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Student teaching placements:</strong> K-12 schools require background checks. Criminal records prevent placement, making degree completion impossible</li>
                    <li><strong>Michigan teaching certificate:</strong> State certification requires disclosure of all criminal convictions. Many convictions result in automatic denial</li>
                    <li><strong>Ongoing disclosure requirements:</strong> Even after certification, teachers must report arrests</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Bronson School of Nursing</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Clinical placements:</strong> Hospitals and healthcare facilities conduct background checks. Any criminal record can disqualify you</li>
                    <li><strong>Michigan nursing license:</strong> The Michigan Board of Nursing reviews criminal history. Drug convictions, theft, assault can result in license denial</li>
                    <li><strong>Program dismissal:</strong> WMU nursing program may dismiss students with criminal charges even before conviction</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>College of Aviation</h4>
                <p>Aviation students face unique challenges:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>FAA background checks:</strong> Federal Aviation Administration conducts thorough background checks for pilot certification</li>
                    <li><strong>DUI convictions:</strong> Can prevent or delay pilot certification</li>
                    <li><strong>Drug convictions:</strong> Absolute disqualifier for commercial pilot careers</li>
                    <li><strong>Airline employment:</strong> Major airlines reject applicants with criminal records</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Career Placement and Graduate School Impact</h2>

                <h3>WMU Career Center and Employer Background Checks</h3>
                <p>WMU's career placement services help students find jobs and internships. <strong>But criminal records create barriers that career services cannot overcome:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Corporate internships:</strong> Fortune 500 companies, major corporations conduct background checks</li>
                    <li><strong>Government positions:</strong> Security clearances impossible with many convictions</li>
                    <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Hospitals, clinics, nursing homes conduct FBI background checks</li>
                    <li><strong>Education:</strong> Teaching positions require state background checks</li>
                    <li><strong>Licensed professions:</strong> Nursing, pharmacy, law, psychology, social work all review criminal history</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Career services cannot help students who fail background checks. Your WMU degree becomes less valuable if you cannot pass employer screening.</p>

                <h3>Graduate School Applications</h3>
                <p>Many WMU students plan to continue their education. Criminal records create significant barriers:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Law school:</strong> Detailed criminal history required; state bars conduct separate "character and fitness" investigations</li>
                    <li><strong>Medical school:</strong> Criminal history questions on applications; convictions for violence, drugs, or dishonesty heavily scrutinized</li>
                    <li><strong>MBA programs:</strong> Business schools ask about criminal history; top programs may reject applicants with convictions</li>
                    <li><strong>PhD programs:</strong> Academic programs review conduct for teaching assistant and research positions</li>
                    <li><strong>Master's in education:</strong> Requires background checks for field placements</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Protecting Your Financial Aid and Scholarships</h2>

                <h3>Federal Financial Aid</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Alcohol offenses (MIP, OWI):</strong> Generally do NOT affect federal aid eligibility</li>
                    <li><strong>Drug convictions:</strong> WILL affect FAFSA eligibility immediately</li>
                    <li>Must report drug convictions on FAFSA applications</li>
                    <li>Loss of eligibility can be temporary or permanent depending on the offense</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>WMU Institutional Scholarships</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Merit scholarships:</strong> Presidential Scholarship, Medallion Scholarship, etc. require "good standing"</li>
                    <li><strong>Good standing definition:</strong> Not on academic or disciplinary probation</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk:</strong> If WMU takes disciplinary action (probation, suspension), you may lose merit scholarships immediately</li>
                    <li><strong>Departmental scholarships:</strong> Business, education, aviation, engineering departments have conduct requirements</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Athletic Scholarships and NCAA Eligibility</h3>
                <p>WMU competes in NCAA Division I with strong programs in football, basketball, hockey, and other sports. Student-athletes face additional consequences:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Team suspension:</strong> Coaches often suspend athletes immediately upon arrest</li>
                    <li><strong>Loss of playing time:</strong> Can affect athletic career development</li>
                    <li><strong>Scholarship review:</strong> Athletic scholarships are renewed annually - arrests can lead to non-renewal</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>International Student Immigration Consequences</h2>

                <p>WMU enrolls international students from around the world. International students on F-1 visas face unique and severe consequences from criminal charges:</p>

                <h3>Visa Status Risks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Criminal convictions can result in visa revocation</strong></li>
                    <li>Drug convictions are particularly serious - can trigger deportation proceedings</li>
                    <li>Crimes of moral turpitude (theft, fraud, assault) can make you inadmissible to the U.S.</li>
                    <li>Even a conviction that doesn't result in jail time can affect visa status</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Maintaining Legal Status</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you're suspended from WMU, you lose F-1 status (no longer enrolled full-time)</li>
                    <li>Loss of F-1 status requires you to leave the U.S. immediately</li>
                    <li>Cannot transfer to another university while deportation proceedings are pending</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>International students must consult with both a criminal defense attorney and an immigration attorney.</strong></p>

                <h2>What to Do Immediately After Being Arrested as a WMU Student</h2>

                <h3>1. Exercise Your Right to Remain Silent</h3>
                <p><strong>Do NOT talk to the police without an attorney present.</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Police may tell you "this will go easier if you just explain what happened" - this is not true</li>
                    <li>Everything you say can and will be used against you</li>
                    <li>Politely say: "I want to remain silent and I want to speak with an attorney"</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Do NOT Post on Social Media</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not post about the arrest on Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter, or Facebook</li>
                    <li>Prosecutors regularly review social media</li>
                    <li>Even "private" messages can be subpoenaed</li>
                    <li>Tell your friends not to post about it either</li>

                <ul>

                    <li>Do not make statements about what happened</li>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions - WMU Student Defense</h2>

                <h3>Will WMU find out about my criminal charges?</h3>
                <p>WMU may find out through several channels: if the arrest occurred on campus (WMU Police report to Student Conduct), if you're required to report to your academic program, if you miss classes for court, or if a conviction affects your financial aid. The university does not automatically receive notifications of off-campus arrests.</p>

                <h3>Can I lose my financial aid because of an MIP?</h3>
                <p>For alcohol-related charges like MIP, you typically will NOT lose federal financial aid. However, drug convictions CAN affect your FAFSA eligibility. WMU scholarships may have conduct requirements that could be affected by any criminal conviction.</p>

                <h3>Does your firm travel to Kalamazoo for WMU student cases?</h3>
                <p>Yes. We regularly represent clients in Kalamazoo County's 8th District Court and 9th Circuit Court. We are familiar with the judges, prosecutors, and procedures in Kalamazoo courts. We understand that WMU represents a significant market with over 16,000 students.</p>

                <h3>How will this affect my business, education, or nursing program?</h3>
                <p>Professional programs at WMU have strict conduct requirements because of state licensing boards and employer background checks. Nursing students with drug or theft convictions may be denied state licensure. Education students must pass background checks. Business students seeking CPA certification face extensive screening. Address criminal charges immediately to protect your ability to continue in these programs.</p>
