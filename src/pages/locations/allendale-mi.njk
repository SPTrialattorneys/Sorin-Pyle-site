                <h2>Why GVSU Students Need Specialized Defense</h2>

                <p>Criminal charges don't just affect your legal record—they threaten your entire college experience. GVSU students facing criminal charges risk:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Suspension or expulsion from GVSU</strong> through university disciplinary proceedings</li>
                    <li><strong>Loss of scholarships and financial aid</strong> (many require maintaining good conduct)</li>
                    <li><strong>Losing on-campus housing</strong> and access to campus facilities</li>
                    <li><strong>Destroyed career prospects</strong>—criminal records disqualify students from internships, graduate schools, and professional licenses</li>
                    <li><strong>International student immigration consequences</strong>—criminal convictions can result in deportation or visa denial</li>
                    <li><strong>Greek life expulsion</strong>—fraternities and sororities often have zero-tolerance policies</li>
                    <li><strong>Athletic eligibility loss</strong>—NCAA and university rules may suspend or remove student-athletes</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We understand these stakes. Our defense strategy protects not just your legal case, but your entire college career.</p>

                <hr class="hr-divider">

                <h2>Common Criminal Charges for GVSU Students</h2>

                <p>Allendale police and Ottawa County Sheriff's deputies patrol campus, off-campus housing, and the surrounding area aggressively. We defend GVSU students against all types of charges:</p>

                <div class="grid_2-col margin-bottom-lg">
                    <div>
                        <h3>Minor in Possession (MIP) / Underage Drinking</h3>
                        <p>MIP is the most common charge for GVSU students. Police conduct frequent party patrols in off-campus housing areas, downtown Allendale bars, and campus events. An MIP conviction results in fines, probation, community service, and a criminal record—but we can often negotiate dismissals or diversion programs that keep your record clean. <strong>Don't plead guilty to MIP without talking to us first.</strong></p>

                        <h3>Fake ID Charges</h3>
                        <p>Using a fake ID at Allendale bars, liquor stores, or downtown establishments results in serious charges. Michigan law treats fake ID possession and use as a misdemeanor with fines up to $100 and potential jail time. More seriously, you may face identity theft charges if the ID uses someone else's information—a felony. We defend fake ID cases aggressively and work to avoid criminal records that destroy career opportunities.</p>

                        <h3>Drug Possession (Marijuana, Cocaine, Pills)</h3>
                        <p>Drug possession charges are common in Allendale, from marijuana possession in dorms to prescription drug sharing (Adderall, Xanax, Vicodin). Even though marijuana is legal in Michigan for adults 21+, GVSU students under 21 still face criminal charges. Harder drugs like cocaine, MDMA, or pills without prescriptions result in serious misdemeanor or felony charges. We fight drug charges by challenging illegal searches, questioning police procedures, and negotiating diversion programs.</p>

                        <h3>DUI / OWI</h3>
                        <p>GVSU students get arrested for DUI while driving home from downtown bars, off-campus parties, or Grand Rapids nightlife. A DUI conviction results in license suspension, fines, probation, alcohol classes, and a criminal record that affects insurance rates and employment. We challenge breathalyzer results, field sobriety tests, and police procedures to fight DUI charges. <a href="/dui-defense.html">Learn more about DUI defense</a>.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Domestic Violence</h3>
                        <p>Domestic violence charges often arise from arguments between dating partners in dorms or off-campus housing. Michigan law requires police to arrest someone whenever they respond to domestic calls, even if no one was injured. These cases are complicated—prosecutors proceed even when alleged victims want charges dropped. A DV conviction results in loss of gun rights, no-contact orders, and immigration consequences. We defend students against false accusations and exaggerated claims. <a href="/domestic-violence-defense.html">Learn more about domestic violence defense</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Disorderly Conduct & Disturbing the Peace</h3>
                        <p>Noise complaints, rowdy behavior at parties, public intoxication, and disturbances in off-campus neighborhoods result in disorderly conduct charges. These may seem minor, but they create criminal records. We work to dismiss or reduce these charges.</p>

                        <h3>Assault & Battery</h3>
                        <p>Bar fights, party disputes, and altercations at downtown Allendale establishments can escalate into assault charges. Simple assault is a misdemeanor, but aggravated assault or felonious assault are felonies with prison time. We defend assault cases by demonstrating self-defense, challenging witness credibility, and negotiating reduced charges.</p>

                        <h3>Theft & Retail Fraud</h3>
                        <p>Shoplifting from Walmart, Meijer, or campus stores results in retail fraud charges that create permanent criminal records. Even first-time offenders face serious consequences. We negotiate dismissals and diversion programs to keep your record clean.</p>

                        <h3>Hazing Charges</h3>
                        <p>Michigan's anti-hazing law criminalizes fraternity, sorority, and athletic team hazing. Students involved in hazing incidents face misdemeanor or felony charges depending on injuries. These cases are highly sensitive and require immediate legal representation.</p>
                    </div>

                <h2>Allendale's 58th District Court</h2>

                <p>All criminal cases for Allendale and GVSU students are prosecuted in the 58th District Court, which has a division specifically handling Allendale-area cases.</p>

                <p><strong>58th District Court - Holland Division</strong><br>
                414 Washington Avenue, Suite 300, Holland, MI 49423</p>

                <p>The 58th District Court handles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All misdemeanor cases (MIP, DUI, assault, drug possession, disorderly conduct)</li>
                    <li>Preliminary examinations for felony cases (before they're sent to 20th Circuit Court in Grand Haven)</li>
                    <li>Traffic violations and civil infractions</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We regularly appear in the 58th District Court and know the judges and prosecutors who handle Allendale cases. This familiarity gives our clients a significant advantage.</p>

                <p><strong>Never miss a court date.</strong> Missing court results in a bench warrant for your arrest. If you've missed a court date, call us immediately at <strong>(616) 227-3303</strong> to resolve the warrant before police arrest you on campus or at your apartment.</p>

                <hr class="hr-divider">

                <h2>Dual Proceedings: Criminal Court & University Discipline</h2>

                <p>GVSU students facing criminal charges often face <strong>two separate proceedings simultaneously</strong>:</p>

                <h4>1. Criminal Court (58th District Court / 20th Circuit Court)</h4>
                <p>This is where the state prosecutes your criminal charges. Outcomes include jail, fines, probation, and criminal records.</p>

                <h4>2. GVSU Office of Student Conduct & Conflict Resolution</h4>
                <p>GVSU runs its own disciplinary process that can result in suspension, expulsion, or conduct probation—even if you're found not guilty in criminal court or charges are dismissed.</p>

                <p><strong>Important:</strong> What you say in university disciplinary hearings can be used against you in criminal court. DO NOT participate in university proceedings without consulting us first. We coordinate both proceedings to protect your rights in both forums.</p>

                <h2>What to Do If You're Arrested in Allendale</h2>

                <p>If Allendale police or Ottawa County Sheriff's deputies arrest you (on campus or off-campus), follow these critical steps:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Remain silent.</strong> DO NOT talk to police without a lawyer present. Say: "I am invoking my right to remain silent, and I want to speak with an attorney." Police may tell you that talking will help—it won't. Anything you say WILL be used against you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not consent to searches.</strong> Police may ask to search your dorm room, apartment, car, phone, or backpack. Politely say, "I do not consent to any searches." Do not physically resist, but clearly state you don't consent.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not resist arrest.</strong> Even if the arrest seems unfair, do not physically resist. Resisting arrest is an additional criminal charge that makes everything worse.</li>
                    <li><strong>Call an attorney immediately.</strong> Call us at <strong>(616) 227-3303</strong> as soon as you can. The sooner we start working on your case, the better your outcome.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do NOT talk to GVSU Student Conduct without consulting us first.</strong> University officials may contact you for disciplinary proceedings. Do not attend these meetings or make statements without legal advice. What you say can be used against you in criminal court.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do NOT post on social media.</strong> Prosecutors will review your Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok looking for evidence. Do not post about your arrest, the charges, or anything related to your case. Assume everything you post online will be shown to a judge or jury.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tell your parents.</strong> If you're financially dependent on your parents, you'll likely need their help hiring an attorney. It's better to tell them immediately than to let them find out later when the situation is worse.</li>
                    <li><strong>Document everything.</strong> Write down what happened, names of witnesses, and any evidence supporting your defense. Take photos of injuries or property damage. Preserve text messages and communications that support your side of the story.</li>
                </ol>

                <hr class="hr-divider">

                <h2>Protecting International Students</h2>

                <p>GVSU has hundreds of international students from around the world. If you're an international student facing criminal charges, the stakes are even higher:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Visa consequences:</strong> Criminal convictions can result in visa denial, inability to renew your visa, or deportation.</li>
                    <li><strong>F-1 student visa status:</strong> University suspension or expulsion terminates your F-1 status, requiring you to leave the United States.</li>
                    <li><strong>Future immigration:</strong> Criminal records affect future visa applications, green card eligibility, and citizenship applications.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We understand immigration consequences and work with immigration attorneys when necessary to protect your ability to remain in the United States and continue your education.</p>

                <hr class="hr-divider">

                <h2>Campus Party Enforcement in Allendale</h2>

                <p>Allendale police and Ottawa County Sheriff's deputies conduct regular party patrols in off-campus housing areas, especially on weekends and during welcome week. Common enforcement tactics include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Noise complaint responses:</strong> Police respond to noise complaints and issue tickets for MIP, open container, and disorderly conduct</li>
                    <li><strong>Party raids:</strong> Officers enter parties (often without warrants) and detain everyone present for questioning</li>
                    <li><strong>Bar checks:</strong> Undercover operations and ID checks at downtown Allendale bars</li>
                    <li><strong>Patrol saturation:</strong> Increased police presence during high-risk times (Labor Day weekend, Halloween, Homecoming, graduation weekend)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Know your rights:</strong> You do not have to open your door or let police into your apartment without a warrant unless they have exigent circumstances (someone screaming, immediate danger, etc.). If police knock, you can speak to them through the door or not answer at all. If they have a warrant, they will show it to you.</p>
