                <h2>Why Choose a Criminal Defense Attorney for Saugatuck Cases?</h2>

                <p>Saugatuck's status as a tourist destination creates unique challenges for criminal defense. Here's why you need an attorney who understands this environment:</p>

                <div class="advantages-list margin-bottom-lg">
                    <div class="advantage-item">
                        <h4>📍 We Know Saugatuck's 57th District Court</h4>
                        <p>The 57th District Court in Allegan handles all misdemeanor cases and preliminary examinations for felonies in Saugatuck. This court sees a significant volume of tourist-related offenses during summer months—DUI arrests, boating violations, disorderly conduct, and public intoxication. We regularly appear in this court and understand how these cases are prosecuted in Allegan County.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="advantage-item">
                        <h4>🚤 Experience with Boating Under the Influence (BUI)</h4>
                        <p>Saugatuck's location on Lake Michigan and the Kalamazoo River means BUI arrests are common, especially during summer boating season. BUI charges carry the same penalties as DUI—jail time, fines, and a criminal record. We know how to challenge breathalyzer results on the water, question officer observations, and defend against marine enforcement tactics.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="advantage-item">
                        <h4>⚖️ Defending Tourists and Out-of-Town Defendants</h4>
                        <p>If you were arrested while visiting Saugatuck, you face additional complications—traveling back to Michigan for court dates, unfamiliarity with local courts, and difficulty finding local representation. We can appear on your behalf for many court dates, minimizing your travel burden. We also understand how prosecutors handle out-of-town defendants and can negotiate effectively on your behalf.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="advantage-item">
                        <h4>🏛️ Trial Experience in Allegan County's 48th Circuit Court</h4>
                        <p>Felony cases in Saugatuck are tried in the 48th Circuit Court in Allegan. We have extensive trial experience in this court and know the judges, prosecutors, and procedures. This knowledge is critical when your case goes to trial or when negotiating serious felony charges.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="advantage-item">
                        <h4>🌊 Understanding Seasonal Law Enforcement Patterns</h4>
                        <p>Law enforcement presence in Saugatuck increases dramatically during summer months, with heightened patrols on highways like I-196, Blue Star Highway, and on the waterways. We understand how seasonal enforcement patterns affect cases and can challenge stops and arrests that may result from aggressive policing during high-traffic periods.</p>

                <h2>Common Criminal Charges in Saugatuck, MI</h2>

                <p>We defend Saugatuck residents and visitors against all types of criminal charges, including:</p>

                <div class="grid_2-col margin-bottom-lg">
                    <div>
                        <h3>DUI / OWI Charges</h3>
                        <p>Saugatuck sees frequent DUI arrests on I-196, Blue Star Highway (M-89), and local roads, especially during Tulip Time, summer weekends, and festival seasons. Police conduct traffic stops aggressively during peak tourist periods. If you've been arrested for drunk driving in Saugatuck, we can challenge breathalyzer results, field sobriety tests, and police procedures. <a href="/dui-defense.html">Learn more about our DUI defense services</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Boating Under the Influence (BUI)</h3>
                        <p>BUI arrests are extremely common in Saugatuck due to heavy recreational boating on Lake Michigan and the Kalamazoo River. Michigan State Police and local marine patrols conduct water stops throughout summer. BUI convictions carry the same penalties as DUI—up to 93 days in jail, fines up to $500, and a criminal record. We defend BUI cases by challenging sobriety testing on the water, officer training, and probable cause for the stop.</p>

                        <h3>Domestic Violence</h3>
                        <p>Domestic violence arrests can occur anywhere—including vacation rentals and hotels. Police are required to make an arrest when called to a domestic disturbance, even if no one was injured and the alleged victim doesn't want charges filed. Prosecutors in Allegan County pursue these cases aggressively. We defend against false accusations, mutual combat situations, and cases where you acted in self-defense. <a href="/domestic-violence-defense.html">Learn more about domestic violence defense</a>.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Disorderly Conduct & Public Intoxication</h3>
                        <p>Summer crowds, beach parties, and nightlife lead to disorderly conduct arrests in Saugatuck. These charges often stem from noise complaints, public intoxication, or altercations in bars and restaurants. While these may seem like minor charges, a conviction can result in a criminal record and impact employment. We work to have these charges dismissed or reduced to civil infractions.</p>

                        <h3>Drug Charges</h3>
                        <p>Marijuana is legal in Michigan, but you can still be charged with possession of other drugs—cocaine, MDMA, prescription drugs, or mushrooms. Drug arrests in tourist areas like Saugatuck often result from traffic stops, hotel searches, or beach patrols. We defend all drug charges and work to get charges reduced or dismissed through diversion programs when possible.</p>

                        <h3>Assault & Battery</h3>
                        <p>Bar fights, beach altercations, and disputes at summer events can result in assault charges. We defend clients by demonstrating self-defense, challenging witness credibility, and negotiating reduced charges to avoid jail time and criminal records.</p>

                        <h3>Minor in Possession (MIP) & Fake ID Charges</h3>
                        <p>College students and young adults visiting Saugatuck frequently face MIP charges or fake ID violations when attempting to enter bars or purchase alcohol. These charges can impact college enrollment, scholarships, and future employment. We help young people protect their futures by getting charges dismissed or reduced.</p>

                <h2>What to Do If You're Arrested in Saugatuck</h2>

                <p>If you're arrested by Saugatuck police, Allegan County Sheriff's deputies, or Michigan State Police, follow these steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Remain silent.</strong> Do NOT talk to police without a lawyer present. Invoke your right to remain silent and request an attorney immediately. This applies whether you're arrested on land or on the water.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not consent to searches.</strong> Police may ask to search your car, boat, phone, hotel room, or rental property. Politely decline and say you do not consent to searches.</li>

                    <li><strong>Do not post about your case on social media.</strong> Prosecutors will review your Facebook, Instagram, and other accounts looking for evidence against you—including photos from your Saugatuck vacation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Document everything.</strong> Write down what happened while it's fresh in your mind, including names of witnesses, photos of the scene, and any evidence supporting your defense.</li>
