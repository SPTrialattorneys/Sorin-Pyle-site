                <h2>Why Local Representation Matters in Zeeland</h2>

                <p>In a small community like Zeeland, criminal charges carry extra weight. Your neighbors know you, your children attend local schools, and your reputation matters professionally and personally. You need attorneys who understand these stakes:</p>

                        <p>Ottawa County, particularly in communities like Zeeland, tends toward more conservative prosecution.

                <h2>Common Criminal Charges in Zeeland, MI</h2>

                <p>We defend Zeeland residents against all types of criminal charges, including:</p>

                <div class="grid_2-col margin-bottom-lg">
                    <div>
                        <h3>DUI / OWI Charges</h3>
                        <p>Zeeland police conduct traffic enforcement along Main Avenue, State Street, and surrounding areas. DUI arrests often occur on weekends or after community events when residents are traveling home. Ottawa County takes drunk driving seriously, and prosecutors pursue these cases aggressively. We challenge breathalyzer results, field sobriety tests, and police procedures to fight your charges. <a href="/dui-defense.html">Learn more about our DUI defense services</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Domestic Violence</h3>
                        <p>Domestic violence arrests happen in every community, including Zeeland. Police must arrest someone when called to a domestic disturbance, even if the situation was a misunderstanding or blown out of proportion. In close communities like Zeeland, domestic violence charges can devastate family relationships and community standing. We defend against false accusations, mutual combat situations, and exaggerated claims. <a href="/domestic-violence-defense.html">Learn more about domestic violence defense</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Drug Charges</h3>
                        <p>Ottawa County prosecutes drug offenses aggressively, including marijuana possession (even small amounts), prescription drug violations, and more serious charges. Many cases involve illegal searches during traffic stops or questionable police procedures. We challenge the evidence and fight for dismissals, reduced charges, or diversion programs.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Minor in Possession (MIP)</h3>
                        <p>Zeeland's youth population faces MIP charges from underage drinking at parties, school events, or local gatherings. These charges can affect college admissions, scholarships, and future employment. We help young people avoid convictions through diversion programs and reduced charges.</p>

                        <h3>Retail Fraud & Theft</h3>
                        <p>Theft charges in Zeeland often stem from incidents at local businesses like Meijer, Family Fare, or downtown retailers. Even first-time shoplifting can result in criminal records. In a small community, a theft conviction can destroy your reputation permanently. We fight to protect your record through dismissals or reduced charges.</p>

                        <h3>Assault & Battery</h3>
                        <p>Assault charges can arise from disputes between neighbors, altercations at school functions, or confrontations that escalated unexpectedly. We defend clients by demonstrating self-defense, challenging witness credibility, and negotiating reduced charges.</p>

                <h2>Protecting Zeeland Residents' Futures</h2>

                <p>When you're charged with a crime in Zeeland, you're facing serious consequences that extend beyond the legal system:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Jail time or probation with strict conditions</li>
                    <li>Fines and court costs</li>

                <h2>What to Do If You're Arrested in Zeeland</h2>

                <p>If Zeeland police or Ottawa County Sheriff's deputies arrest you, follow these critical steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Remain silent.</strong> Do NOT talk to police without a lawyer present. Invoke your right to remain silent and request an attorney immediately. Anything you say will be used against you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not consent to searches.</strong> Police may ask to search your car, phone, or home. Politely decline and say you do not consent to searches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Call an attorney immediately.</strong> The sooner we start working on your case, the better. Call us at <strong>(616) 227-3303</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not post about your case on social media.</strong> In a small community like Zeeland, word spreads quickly. Prosecutors will review your social media accounts, and so will your neighbors. Don't post anything about your arrest or charges.</li>
                    <li><strong>Document everything.</strong> Write down what happened while it's fresh in your mind, including names of witnesses, photos of injuries, and any evidence supporting your defense.</li>
                </ol>

                <hr class="hr-divider">

                <h2>Conservative Prosecution Strategies in Ottawa County</h2>

                <p>Ottawa County, particularly in communities like Zeeland, tends toward more conservative prosecution approaches. This means:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Higher expectations for accountability</strong> and compliance with court orders</li>
                    <li><strong>Conservative judges and juries</strong> who take law and order seriously</li>
                    <li><strong>Strong emphasis on family values</strong> in domestic violence and juvenile cases</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We understand this environment and know how to navigate it effectively. Our defense strategies account for local values while aggressively protecting your constitutional rights.</p>
