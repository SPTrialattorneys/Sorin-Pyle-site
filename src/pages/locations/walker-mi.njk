                <h2>Common Criminal Charges in Walker, MI</h2>

                <p>We defend Walker residents against all types of criminal charges, including:</p>

                <div class="grid_2-col margin-bottom-lg">
                    <div>
                        <h3>DUI / OWI Charges</h3>
                        <p>Walker police conduct frequent traffic stops and DUI enforcement along Alpine Avenue (M-37), Lake Michigan Drive, and residential streets. DUI arrests often occur near bars and restaurants along the Alpine Avenue corridor. If you've been arrested for drunk driving in Walker, we can challenge breathalyzer results, field sobriety tests, and the legality of the traffic stop. <a href="/dui-defense.html">Learn more about our DUI defense services</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Domestic Violence</h3>
                        <p>Domestic violence arrests are common in suburban communities like Walker. Police are required to make an arrest when called to a domestic disturbance, even if no injuries occurred and the alleged victim wants charges dropped. Kent County prosecutors pursue these cases aggressively. We defend against false accusations, mutual combat situations, and cases where you acted in self-defense. A domestic violence conviction carries serious consequences—loss of gun rights, potential jail time, and a permanent criminal record. <a href="/domestic-violence-defense.html">Learn more about domestic violence defense</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Drug Charges</h3>
                        <p>Drug charges in Walker typically arise from traffic stops, search warrants, or controlled buys. Whether you're facing possession of marijuana (over legal limits), cocaine, methamphetamine, prescription drugs, or more serious charges like possession with intent to deliver, we provide aggressive defense. Many drug cases can be resolved through diversion programs, reduced charges, or outright dismissals when police violated your rights.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Theft & Retail Fraud</h3>
                        <p>Retail fraud (shoplifting) charges are prosecuted aggressively in Walker, with major retailers along Alpine Avenue actively pursuing charges. Even first-time offenders face criminal records, fines, and potential jail time. We work to have charges dismissed, negotiate civil settlements, or reduce charges to avoid a theft conviction that will follow you for life.</p>

                        <h3>Assault & Battery</h3>
                        <p>Assault charges in Walker can arise from bar fights, neighborhood disputes, or altercations at businesses along the commercial corridor. We defend clients by demonstrating self-defense, challenging witness credibility, and negotiating reduced charges. Assault convictions can result in jail time, probation, and a violent crime on your record.</p>

                        <h3>Traffic Offenses</h3>
                        <p>Reckless driving, driving while license suspended (DWLS), leaving the scene of an accident, and other serious traffic offenses can result in jail time, license suspension, and a criminal record. Walker police actively enforce traffic laws on major roads like Alpine Avenue and I-96. We help Walker drivers protect their licenses and avoid criminal convictions.</p>

                        <h3>Weapons Charges</h3>
                        <p>Carrying a concealed weapon (CCW) without a permit, felon in possession of a firearm, and brandishing charges are taken seriously in Kent County. We defend gun owners and ensure your Second Amendment rights are protected while fighting weapons charges that can result in felony convictions.</p>

                <h2>Protecting Walker Residents' Rights</h2>

                <p>When you're charged with a crime in Walker, you're facing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Jail time or prison sentences</li>
                    <li>Fines and court costs (often thousands of dollars)</li>
                    <li>Probation with strict conditions (drug testing, no alcohol, community service)</li>
                    <li>A permanent criminal record visible on background checks</li>
                    <li>Loss of employment and difficulty finding new jobs</li>
                    <li>Difficulty finding housing (landlords deny applicants with criminal records)</li>

                </ul>

                <p>Our job is to protect you from these consequences. We investigate every case thoroughly, challenge the prosecution's evidence, and fight for dismissals, not guilty verdicts, or reduced charges. When trial isn't the best option, we negotiate aggressively for the most favorable outcome possible.</p>

                <h2>What to Do If You're Arrested in Walker</h2>

                <p>If Walker police or Kent County Sheriff's deputies arrest you, follow these steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Remain silent.</strong> Do NOT talk to police without a lawyer present. Anything you say WILL be used against you. Invoke your right to remain silent and request an attorney immediately.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not consent to searches.</strong> Police may ask to search your car, phone, or home. Politely decline and say you do not consent to searches. Do not physically resist, but make it clear you are not giving permission.</li>
                    <li><strong>Call an attorney immediately.</strong> The sooner we start working on your case, the better your outcome. Call us at <strong>(616) 227-3303</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not post about your case on social media.</strong> Prosecutors will review your Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and other accounts looking for evidence against you. Anything you post can and will be used in court.</li>
                    <li><strong>Document everything.</strong> Write down what happened while it's fresh in your mind, including names of witnesses, photos of injuries or the scene, and any evidence supporting your defense.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not talk to the alleged victim (in domestic cases).</strong> If you're arrested for domestic violence, do NOT contact the alleged victim—this will result in additional charges for violating a no-contact order.</li>
                </ol>
