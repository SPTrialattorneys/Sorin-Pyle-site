                <h1>Jonathan Pyle</h1>
                <p>I grew up right here in West Michigan, and after pursuing my education across the country, I knew I had to come back home to serve the community that raised me. My time at the University of Georgia gave me a world-class legal education, but my work here, defending my neighbors, gives me purpose.</p>
                <p>I believe a good defense is built on relentless preparation and a genuine connection with my client. I will take the time to understand your situation, and I will be the steady hand you need to navigate the storm.</p>
