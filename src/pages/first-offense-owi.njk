                <p class="text-align-center sub-headline">Most first-time offenders avoid jail. Here's what you're really facing—and how to fight back.</p>
                <p class="text-align-center margin-bottom-lg">If you've been arrested for your first OWI in Michigan, you're terrified. You're worried about going to jail, losing your job, and ruining your future. <strong>Here's the truth: Most first-time OWI offenders in Michigan do not go to jail.</strong> While the law allows up to 93 days in jail, judges typically impose probation, community service, and fines instead—especially for first offenses without aggravating factors. However, you need an experienced attorney to help you navigate this process and fight for the best possible outcome.</p>

                        <h2>Understanding First Offense OWI in Michigan</h2>

                        <p><strong>First offense Operating While Intoxicated (OWI)</strong> is the most common drunk driving charge in Michigan. Under <strong>MCL 257.625(1)</strong>, it's illegal to operate a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content (BAC) of <strong>0.08% or higher</strong>, or while intoxicated by alcohol, controlled substances, or any combination thereof.</p>

                        <p>A first offense OWI is classified as a <strong>misdemeanor</strong>, not a felony. However, that doesn't mean it's not serious. A conviction creates a permanent criminal record, results in driver's license suspension, and can cost you thousands of dollars in fines, increased insurance, lost wages, and legal fees.</p>

                        <h3>Common First Offense OWI Scenarios</h3>
                        <p>First-time offenders come from all walks of life. Here are the most common situations we see:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Had a few drinks at dinner or a bar:</strong> You felt fine to drive but got pulled over for a minor traffic violation (broken taillight, rolling stop, etc.). One thing led to another, and you were arrested for OWI.</li>
                            <li><strong>Celebrating with friends or coworkers:</strong> You had more to drink than you realized at a birthday party, wedding, or work event. You thought you were okay to drive home.</li>
                            <li><strong>Misjudged your alcohol consumption:</strong> You waited a few hours after drinking, ate food, drank water—but your BAC was still over the legal limit when you drove.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pulled over at a sobriety checkpoint:</strong> You were driving through a DUI checkpoint and police smelled alcohol or observed signs of impairment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Anonymous tip or report:</strong> Someone called police reporting a suspected drunk driver, and you were pulled over based on that report.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>You are not a bad person.</strong> Good people make mistakes. The difference between a conviction that ruins your life and a favorable outcome often comes down to having the right attorney by your side from day one.</p>

                        <h2>First Offense OWI Penalties: What You're Facing</h2>

                        <p>Here's exactly what the law allows for a first offense OWI in Michigan:</p>

                        <h3>Criminal Penalties</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Jail Time:</strong> Up to 93 days in county jail (most first-timers avoid jail)</li>
                            <li><strong>Fines:</strong> $100 to $500 (plus mandatory court costs often exceeding $1,000)</li>
                            <li><strong>Community Service:</strong> Up to 360 hours of community service may be ordered</li>
                            <li><strong>Probation:</strong> Typically 1 to 2 years with conditions (alcohol testing, reporting, counseling)</li>
                            <li><strong>Substance Abuse Screening:</strong> Mandatory evaluation and possible treatment program</li>
                            <li><strong>Victim Impact Panel:</strong> Attendance at MADD or similar victim impact presentation</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Driver's License Sanctions</h3>
                        <p>Your license will be suspended for <strong>180 days total</strong>, broken down as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>First 30 days:</strong> Hard suspension (absolutely NO driving for any reason)</li>
                            <li><strong>Remaining 150 days:</strong> Restricted license (can drive to/from work, school, medical appointments, court-ordered programs)</li>
                            <li><strong>6 points added to your driving record</strong></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>CRITICAL:</strong> You have only <strong>14 days from your arrest</strong> to request an administrative hearing to challenge your license suspension. Miss this deadline and you automatically lose your license. <a href="/contact.html">Call us immediately</a> to request your hearing.</p>

                        <h3>The Hidden Costs of a First Offense OWI</h3>
                        <p>Most people focus on fines and jail time, but the true cost of a first offense OWI conviction is much higher:</p>

                        <h2>Beyond Legal Penalties: How a First OWI Conviction Affects Your Life</h2>

                        <p>A first offense OWI isn't just about fines and jail time. It creates a ripple effect that touches every part of your life:</p>

                        <h3>Employment Consequences</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Current job at risk:</strong> Many employers conduct periodic background checks. A criminal conviction may violate company policy and result in termination.</li>
                            <li><strong>Can't get to work:</strong> If you lose your license and have no alternative transportation, you may lose your job simply because you can't show up.</li>
                            <li><strong>Future employment:</strong> Most job applications ask, "Have you ever been convicted of a crime?" A DUI conviction means checking "yes."</li>
                            <li><strong>Promotions blocked:</strong> Management positions often require clean driving records and criminal background checks.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Professional License Impacts</h3>
                        <p>If you hold a professional license, a first offense OWI can trigger disciplinary proceedings:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Nurses:</strong> Michigan Board of Nursing reviews all criminal convictions. A DUI can result in license suspension, probation, or mandatory substance abuse treatment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Teachers:</strong> Michigan Department of Education reviews criminal history. Teaching certifications may be suspended or revoked for alcohol-related offenses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Doctors, Dentists, Pharmacists:</strong> State licensing boards have "moral character" requirements. DUI convictions raise red flags and can result in disciplinary action.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lawyers:</strong> State Bar conducts character and fitness reviews. A DUI can impact bar admission or result in attorney discipline.</li>
                            <li><strong>Commercial Drivers (CDL):</strong> Even if you have a standard license now, a DUI conviction makes you ineligible to obtain a <a href="/cdl-owi-defense.html">CDL for at least 2 years</a> in Michigan.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Insurance Rate Increases</h3>
                        <p>Auto insurance companies treat a DUI conviction as a high-risk factor. Your rates will increase dramatically:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Average increase:</strong> 80% to 150% higher premiums</li>
                            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 3 to 5 years of elevated rates</li>
                            <li><strong>SR-22 requirement:</strong> You must file an SR-22 form (proof of financial responsibility) with the state, which adds to costs</li>
                            <li><strong>Dropped by insurer:</strong> Some insurers refuse to cover drivers with DUI convictions, forcing you to find more expensive coverage</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Security Clearances</h3>
                        <p>If you hold or need a security clearance for your job (federal, state, or defense contracting), a DUI conviction can result in:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Denial of security clearance application</li>
                            <li>Revocation of existing clearance</li>
                            <li>Job loss (many cleared positions require active clearance)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Immigration Consequences</h3>
                        <p>Non-U.S. citizens face additional serious consequences:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Deportation risk:</strong> DUI can be considered a "crime involving moral turpitude" or trigger deportation proceedings</li>
                            <li><strong>Denial of citizenship:</strong> Applicants for naturalization must demonstrate "good moral character"—a DUI conviction works against you</li>
                            <li><strong>Visa problems:</strong> DUI convictions can prevent visa renewal or re-entry to the United States</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>College Admissions and Financial Aid</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>College applications:</strong> Many universities ask about criminal history. A DUI can affect admissions decisions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Scholarships:</strong> Merit-based and athletic scholarships may be revoked for criminal convictions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Federal financial aid:</strong> While a DUI alone doesn't disqualify you from federal student aid, it can if it involves drugs or results in probation/suspension from school.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Housing and Rental Applications</h3>
                        <p>Landlords routinely conduct background checks. A criminal record can result in:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Denial of rental applications</li>
                            <li>Higher security deposits</li>
                            <li>Limited housing options</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> A first offense OWI conviction isn't just a fine and a slap on the wrist. It's a life-altering event with consequences that extend far beyond the courtroom. That's why fighting your case with an experienced attorney is so important.</p>

                    <!-- Section 5: Defense Strategies -->
                    <section class="content-section">
                        <h2>How We Defend First Offense OWI Cases</h2>

                        <p>Just because you were arrested doesn't mean you're automatically guilty. Just because you failed a breathalyzer doesn't mean the case is hopeless. We've successfully defended hundreds of first offense OWI cases by identifying weaknesses in the prosecution's evidence and building aggressive defenses.</p>

                        <h3>1. Challenging the Traffic Stop</h3>
                        <p>Police must have <strong>reasonable suspicion</strong> to pull you over. If the stop was unlawful, all evidence gathered afterward—including breathalyzer results—can be suppressed and the case dismissed.</p>

                        <p><strong>Questions we investigate:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Did police observe a traffic violation or other lawful reason to stop your vehicle?</li>
                            <li>Was the stop based on an anonymous tip? (This often lacks sufficient reliability)</li>
                            <li>Did police exceed the scope of the initial stop? (E.g., stopped you for a taillight, but then went fishing for DUI)</li>
                            <li>Were your constitutional rights violated during the stop?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Real example:</strong> We recently represented a client who was stopped allegedly for "weaving within the lane." After obtaining dash cam footage, we proved the client never crossed lane lines. The traffic stop was illegal, evidence was suppressed, and the case was dismissed.</p>

                        <h3>2. Questioning Field Sobriety Tests</h3>
                        <p>Field sobriety tests (walking a line, standing on one leg, following a pen with your eyes) are notoriously unreliable and subjective. <strong>Studies show that 70% of sober people fail these tests.</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>Common defenses:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Improper administration:</strong> Were the tests administered according to NHTSA standardized procedures? Most officers take shortcuts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Physical conditions:</strong> Do you have injuries, medical conditions, age-related balance issues, or were you wearing improper footwear?</li>
                            <li><strong>Environmental factors:</strong> Was the road uneven? Was it dark? Were there distracting lights from police cars or passing traffic?</li>
                            <li><strong>Officer training:</strong> Was the officer properly certified to administer and interpret these tests?</li>
                            <li><strong>Language barriers:</strong> Did you fully understand the instructions?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>3. Attacking Breathalyzer Results</h3>
                        <p>Breathalyzer machines are not infallible. They're machines operated by humans, and both can make mistakes.</p>

                        <p><strong>Defense strategies:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Machine calibration:</strong> Was the device properly maintained and calibrated according to state requirements?</li>
                            <li><strong>Operator error:</strong> Did the officer follow proper protocols during testing?</li>
                            <li><strong>20-minute observation period:</strong> Michigan law requires officers to observe you continuously for 20 minutes before administering a breath test. Did they?</li>
                            <li><strong>Mouth alcohol contamination:</strong> Did you have residual alcohol in your mouth from dental work, GERD (acid reflux), recent vomiting, or breath spray?</li>
                            <li><strong>Radio frequency interference:</strong> Were there cell phones, police radios, or other devices that could interfere with the machine?</li>
                            <li><strong>Medical conditions:</strong> Do you have diabetes, ketosis, or other conditions that can cause false positives?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>4. Challenging Blood Test Results</h3>
                        <p>Blood tests are considered more accurate than breath tests, but they're still challengeable:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Chain of custody:</strong> Can the prosecution prove your blood sample wasn't contaminated, mislabeled, or mixed up with someone else's?</li>
                            <li><strong>Improper blood draw:</strong> Was the blood drawn by a qualified medical professional using proper procedures?</li>
                            <li><strong>Storage and preservation:</strong> Was the blood stored at proper temperatures? Blood samples can ferment over time, artificially increasing BAC.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lack of consent:</strong> If you didn't consent to a blood test, was a valid search warrant properly obtained?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>5. Proving You Weren't Driving</h3>
                        <p>To convict you of OWI, the prosecution must prove <strong>beyond a reasonable doubt</strong> that you were <em>operating</em> the vehicle while intoxicated.</p>

                        <p>If police didn't actually see you driving, we can argue:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You were sleeping in a parked car with the engine off</li>
                            <li>You were sitting in a parking lot waiting for a sober ride</li>
                            <li>You were found after an accident but no witnesses saw you driving</li>
                            <li>Someone else was driving and you were a passenger</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>If the prosecution can't prove operation, the case should be dismissed.</p>

                        <h3>6. Negotiating Reduced Charges</h3>
                        <p>When trial isn't the best option, we negotiate aggressively for reduced charges that minimize the impact on your life:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>OWI reduced to OWVI (Operating While Visibly Impaired):</strong> A lesser charge with reduced penalties and shorter license suspension (90 days vs 180 days, $300 max fine vs $500, 4 points vs 6 points).</li>
                            <li><strong>OWI reduced to Reckless Driving:</strong> A non-alcohol related charge that doesn't show as DUI on your record</li>
                            <li><strong>Reduced jail time:</strong> House arrest, electronic monitoring, or community service alternatives to incarceration</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>7. Reducing OWI to OWVI for Delayed Sentence Eligibility</h3>
                        <p>One of the most valuable negotiation strategies for first offense OWI is <strong>reducing the charge to OWVI (Operating While Visibly Impaired)</strong>. While OWI itself is NOT eligible for a delayed sentence, OWVI is.</p>

                        <p><strong>What is OWVI?</strong></p>
                        <p>OWVI is a lesser drunk driving charge that applies when a driver's ability to operate a vehicle is visibly impaired by alcohol or drugs, but their BAC may be below 0.08% or the impairment is less severe than OWI.</p>

                        <p><strong>Benefits of reducing OWI to OWVI:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Shorter license suspension:</strong> 90 days restriction (vs. 180 days for OWI)</li>
                            <li><strong>Lower fines:</strong> Up to $300 (vs. $500 for OWI)</li>
                            <li><strong>4 points on license</strong> instead of 6 points</li>
                            <li><strong>Lesser conviction on your record:</strong> "Operating While Visibly Impaired" is significantly less serious than "Operating While Intoxicated" for employment and insurance purposes</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> OWVI is NOT eligible for delayed sentence or deferred adjudication like some drug offenses (MCL 333.7411 applies ONLY to drug possession charges, not traffic offenses). However, OWVI carries significantly reduced penalties compared to OWI, making it a valuable negotiated outcome. An experienced attorney can present mitigating factors and advocate for charge reduction.</p>

                                <p><strong>Most first-time OWI offenders do not go to jail.</strong> While the law allows up to 93 days in jail, judges typically impose probation, community service, and fines instead for standard first offenses without aggravating circumstances.</p>
                                <p>However, jail time becomes more likely if:</p>

                                    <li>You caused an accident or injury</li>
                                    <li>You have prior alcohol-related driving incidents (even if not convictions)</li>
                                    <li>You were driving recklessly or with children in the car</li>
                                    <li>You refused chemical testing (implied consent violation)</li>

                                <summary>How much does a first offense OWI cost in total?</summary>
                                <p><strong>The total cost of a first offense OWI typically ranges from $9,000 to $26,000</strong> when you factor in all expenses:</p>

                                <summary>Can OWI be reduced to a lesser charge?</summary>
                                <p><strong>Yes. One of the most valuable outcomes is reducing OWI to OWVI (Operating While Visibly Impaired) or Reckless Driving.</strong></p>

                                    <li>4 points on license (vs. 6 points for OWI)</li>
                                    <li>Lesser conviction on your record ("visibly impaired" vs. "intoxicated")</li>

                                    <li>Does NOT appear as DUI/OWI on your record</li>
                                    <li>No mandatory license suspension</li>

                                <p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Reductions are more likely if this is your first offense, there are weaknesses in the prosecution's case, you have strong mitigating factors, or you proactively enroll in treatment</p>

                                <p><strong>It depends on your employer's policies and the nature of your job.</strong> Many people do not lose their job for a first offense OWI, but it's a real risk.</p>
                                <p><strong>You're more likely to lose your job if:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Your job requires driving (delivery, sales, transportation)</li>
                                    <li>You hold a professional license (nurse, teacher, doctor, lawyer)</li>
                                    <li>Your employer has a zero-tolerance policy for criminal convictions</li>
                                    <li>Your company conducts periodic background checks</li>
                                    <li>You need security clearance</li>

                                <p><strong>Legal protections:</strong> In Michigan, employers generally cannot fire you solely for being arrested. However, they CAN fire you for being convicted of a crime, especially if it impacts your ability to do your job.</p>
                                <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Don't volunteer information to your employer about the arrest unless required by company policy. Consult with us about your specific situation and whether you should disclose the arrest to your employer.</p>

                                    <li><strong>First 30 days:</strong> Hard suspension (absolutely NO driving for any reason)</li>

                                <p><strong>Yes, restricted licenses are available after the hard suspension period ends.</strong></p>
                                <p>After the first 30 days (or 45 days for super drunk), you can obtain a restricted license that allows you to drive for specific purposes:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>To and from work</li>
                                    <li>During work hours (if your job requires driving)</li>
                                    <li>To and from school</li>
                                    <li>To and from court-ordered programs (substance abuse treatment, probation appointments, etc.)</li>
                                    <li>To and from medical appointments</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>You CANNOT drive on a restricted license for:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Social activities</li>

                                <p><strong>How to get restricted license:</strong> After the hard suspension period, you apply to the Secretary of State for a restricted license. You'll need documentation from your employer and must pay fees. We can guide you through this process.</p>
                                <p><strong>Ignition interlock:</strong> For super drunk cases, you must install an ignition interlock device (breathalyzer connected to your car's ignition) to be eligible for restricted driving.</p>

                                <summary>Should I plead guilty to my first offense OWI?</summary>
                                <p><strong>In most cases, NO—at least not immediately.</strong> Never plead guilty without first:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Consulting with an experienced DUI attorney</li>
                                    <li>Reviewing all evidence against you</li>

                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Why you shouldn't rush to plead guilty:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Just because you were arrested doesn't mean you're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt</li>
                                    <li>Just because you failed a breathalyzer doesn't mean the test was accurate or legally admissible</li>
                                    <li>There may be defenses you're unaware of (illegal stop, improper testing, constitutional violations)</li>
                                    <li>We may be able to negotiate reduced charges (OWI to OWVI or reckless driving) with significantly lesser penalties</li>
                                    <li>Reduced charges result in shorter license suspensions, lower fines, and less severe long-term consequences</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>At your arraignment, plead "not guilty."</strong> This preserves all your rights and options. You can always change your plea later if we negotiate a favorable deal. But once you plead guilty, it's extremely difficult to take it back.</p>

                                <p><strong>Legally, no—you have the right to represent yourself. Practically? Yes, you absolutely need a lawyer.</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>Here's why:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>This is not your first DUI case; it's the prosecutor's 500th.</strong> They know every trick, every defense, and every way to use your words against you. You're outmatched.</li>
                                    <li><strong>The consequences are too high.</strong> A conviction creates a permanent criminal record, costs you $10,000-$25,000 in total expenses, and can cost you your job, license, and future opportunities.</li>
                                    <li><strong>You don't know what you don't know.</strong> Was the traffic stop legal? Was the breathalyzer properly calibrated? Were your rights violated? You need an attorney to identify defenses you'd never recognize.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Prosecutors respect attorneys.</strong> When you have a lawyer, prosecutors know they can't bully you into a bad deal. They take your case seriously.</li>
                                    <li><strong>You only get one shot.</strong> You can't go back and "redo" your case later. If you lose at trial representing yourself, it's over. An experienced attorney gives you the best chance at a favorable outcome the first time.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Statistics show:</strong> Defendants represented by experienced DUI attorneys receive significantly better outcomes (dismissals, reduced charges, no jail time) compared to those who represent themselves or use inexperienced lawyers.</p>
                                <p><strong>Our advice:</strong> At minimum, schedule a free consultation with us to understand your options. Then make an informed decision about whether to hire an attorney. Call <strong>(616) 227-3303</strong> now.</p>

                                <p><strong>Reduced charges: Yes, often possible through negotiation.</strong></p>
                                <p>We frequently negotiate first offense OWI charges down to lesser offenses:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>OWVI (Operating While Visibly Impaired):</strong> Lesser charge with significantly reduced penalties (90-day license restriction vs 180 days, $300 max fine vs $500, 4 points vs 6 points)</li>
                                    <li><strong>Reckless Driving:</strong> Non-alcohol traffic offense (no DUI on record, no mandatory license suspension)</li>

                                <p><strong>Expungement: Yes, but with limitations.</strong></p>
                                <p>Michigan law now allows you to <a href="/record-expungement.html">expunge (set aside) a first offense OWI conviction</a>, but only if:</p>

                                    <li>It was your <strong>only OWI conviction</strong> (first and only drunk driving offense)</li>

                                    <li>It will still count as a "first offense" for purposes of any future DUI charges</li>
                                    <li>But it will NOT appear on most public background checks, making it easier to find employment and housing</li>

                                <summary>What if I'm under 21 and charged with first offense OWI?</summary>
                                <p><strong>If you're under 21, Michigan's "Zero Tolerance" law may apply instead of standard OWI.</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>Zero Tolerance Law (MCL 257.625(6)):</strong> Drivers under 21 can be charged with having a BAC of just <strong>0.02% or higher</strong>—that's one-quarter of the adult limit. This means even one drink can result in criminal charges.</p>
                                <p><strong>Zero Tolerance penalties (first offense):</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Fine up to $250 (instead of $500 for standard OWI)</li>
                                    <li>Community service up to 360 hours</li>
                                    <li>License suspended 30 days, then restricted 150 days (same as standard OWI)</li>
                                    <li>4 points on driving record (instead of 6 for OWI)</li>
                                    <li>Substance abuse screening</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>However, if your BAC is 0.08% or higher, you're charged with regular OWI</strong> (even though you're under 21), which carries harsher penalties.</p>
                                <p><strong>Collateral consequences for students:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>University disciplinary proceedings (separate from criminal court)</li>
                                    <li>Risk of housing loss or suspension</li>
                                    <li>Scholarship loss (athletic, academic, or merit-based)</li>

                "text": "A first offense OWI case in Michigan typically takes 2-6 months from arrest to resolution, depending on several factors: court schedule and backlog, whether you request a hearing or trial, complexity of your case (blood tests take longer than breath tests), plea negotiation timeline, and whether there are pre-trial motions to suppress evidence. Cases that go to trial can take 6-12 months or longer. Your attorney can give you a more specific timeline based on your court and circumstances."

                "text": "Michigan law allows you to expunge ONE lifetime OWI conviction, including first offense OWI, if you meet eligibility requirements: 5 years have passed since you completed your sentence (including probation, fines, and classes), you have no other OWI convictions (this is your only one), you have no pending criminal charges, and you meet all other Michigan expungement requirements. Expunging your OWI removes it from most background checks, helping with employment and housing. However, law enforcement and courts can still see expunged OWI convictions for purposes of determining if future offenses are first or second OWI. An attorney can help you file for expungement once you're eligible."

    {"@type": "Question", "name": "Will I go to jail for a first offense OWI in Michigan?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Most first-time OWI offenders do not go to jail. While the law allows up to 93 days in jail, judges typically impose probation, community service, and fines instead for standard first offenses without aggravating circumstances. However, jail time becomes more likely if: your BAC was very high (0.17% or above is super drunk with enhanced penalties), you caused an accident or injury, you have prior alcohol-related driving incidents (even if not convictions), you were driving recklessly or with children in the car, or you refused chemical testing (implied consent violation). An experienced attorney dramatically improves your chances of avoiding jail."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "How much does a first offense OWI cost in total?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The total cost of a first offense OWI typically ranges from $9,000 to $26,000 when you factor in all expenses: court fines and costs ($1,500-$2,500), attorney fees ($2,500-$5,000), increased insurance for 3-5 years ($3,000-$10,000), license reinstatement fees ($125-$200), substance abuse programs ($500-$2,000), lost wages ($1,000-$5,000+), and ignition interlock if required ($1,000-$1,500/year). These numbers don't include potential job loss, professional license consequences, or the emotional toll on you and your family. Hiring an attorney may seem expensive, but the cost of a conviction is far higher."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can I get my first offense OWI charges dismissed?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes, dismissal is possible if we can prove: the traffic stop was illegal (no reasonable suspicion), critical evidence was improperly obtained (constitutional violation), the breathalyzer or blood test was administered incorrectly, the prosecution cannot prove you were operating the vehicle, or your rights were violated during the arrest or investigation. We've successfully gotten first offense OWI charges dismissed for our clients by challenging police procedures, attacking test results, and proving constitutional violations. Every case is different, but we thoroughly investigate to find grounds for dismissal."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can OWI be reduced to a lesser charge?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. One of the most valuable outcomes is reducing OWI to OWVI (Operating While Visibly Impaired) or Reckless Driving. OWVI carries significantly lighter penalties: 90-day license restriction (vs. 180 days for OWI), $300 maximum fine (vs. $500 for OWI), 4 points on license (vs. 6 points for OWI), and lesser conviction on your record. Reckless Driving is a non-alcohol-related traffic offense that does NOT appear as DUI/OWI on your record, has no mandatory license suspension, and is better for employment and insurance purposes. Reductions are more likely if this is your first offense, there are weaknesses in the prosecution's case, you have strong mitigating factors, or you proactively enroll in treatment."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "Will I lose my job for a first offense OWI?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "It depends on your employer's policies and the nature of your job. Many people do not lose their job for a first offense OWI, but it's a real risk. You're more likely to lose your job if: your job requires driving (delivery, sales, transportation), you hold a professional license (nurse, teacher, doctor, lawyer), your employer has a zero-tolerance policy for criminal convictions, your company conducts periodic background checks, you need security clearance, or you can't get to work due to license suspension. In Michigan, employers generally cannot fire you solely for being arrested. However, they CAN fire you for being convicted of a crime, especially if it impacts your ability to do your job. Don't volunteer information to your employer about the arrest unless required by company policy."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "How long is my license suspended for first offense OWI?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "For a standard first offense OWI, your license is suspended for 180 days total: first 30 days is hard suspension (absolutely NO driving for any reason), remaining 150 days is restricted license (can drive to/from work, school, medical appointments, court-ordered programs). For high BAC (.17%+) super drunk first offense: first 45 days is hard suspension (no driving), remaining 320 days is restricted license WITH mandatory ignition interlock device. IMPORTANT: You have only 14 days from arrest to request an administrative hearing to challenge the suspension. If you win this hearing, you may keep your license even if you're later convicted in criminal court. Call us immediately to request your hearing before the deadline passes."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can I get a restricted license for work after a first offense OWI?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes, restricted licenses are available after the hard suspension period ends. After the first 30 days (or 45 days for super drunk), you can obtain a restricted license that allows you to drive for specific purposes: to and from work, during work hours (if your job requires driving), to and from school, to and from court-ordered programs (substance abuse treatment, probation appointments, etc.), and to and from medical appointments. You CANNOT drive on a restricted license for social activities, grocery shopping, running errands, or any purpose not explicitly allowed. After the hard suspension period, you apply to the Secretary of State for a restricted license. You'll need documentation from your employer and must pay fees. For super drunk cases, you must install an ignition interlock device (breathalyzer connected to your car's ignition) to be eligible for restricted driving."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "Should I plead guilty to my first offense OWI?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "In most cases, NO—at least not immediately. Never plead guilty without first: consulting with an experienced DUI attorney, reviewing all evidence against you, exploring potential defenses, and negotiating for reduced charges (OWI to OWVI or reckless driving). Why you shouldn't rush to plead guilty: just because you were arrested doesn't mean you're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, just because you failed a breathalyzer doesn't mean the test was accurate or legally admissible, there may be defenses you're unaware of (illegal stop, improper testing, constitutional violations), we may be able to negotiate reduced charges with significantly lesser penalties, and reduced charges result in shorter license suspensions, lower fines, and less severe long-term consequences. At your arraignment, plead not guilty. This preserves all your rights and options. You can always change your plea later if we negotiate a favorable deal. But once you plead guilty, it's extremely difficult to take it back."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "Do I really need a lawyer for a first offense OWI?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Legally, no—you have the right to represent yourself. Practically? Yes, you absolutely need a lawyer. Here's why: This is not your first DUI case; it's the prosecutor's 500th. They know every trick, every defense, and every way to use your words against you. You're outmatched. The consequences are too high. A conviction creates a permanent criminal record, costs you $10,000-$25,000 in total expenses, and can cost you your job, license, and future opportunities. You don't know what you don't know. Was the traffic stop legal? Was the breathalyzer properly calibrated? Were your rights violated? You need an attorney to identify defenses you'd never recognize. Prosecutors respect attorneys. When you have a lawyer, prosecutors know they can't bully you into a bad deal. They take your case seriously. You only get one shot. You can't go back and redo your case later. Statistics show: Defendants represented by experienced DUI attorneys receive significantly better outcomes (dismissals, reduced charges, no jail time) compared to those who represent themselves or use inexperienced lawyers."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "How long does a first offense OWI case take in Michigan?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Most first offense OWI cases resolve within 3 to 6 months, though some take longer depending on complexity and whether the case goes to trial. Typical timeline: Arraignment (1-2 weeks after arrest) - first court appearance, you enter your plea (not guilty), bond conditions set. Pre-trial conferences (1-3 months) - attorney meets with prosecutor to discuss evidence and negotiate potential plea deals. Motion hearings (if needed) - attorney files motions to suppress evidence, dismiss charges, etc. Trial or plea (3-6 months) - case resolves either through negotiated plea agreement or trial. Sentencing (if convicted) - judge imposes sentence (probation, fines, community service, etc.). Factors that affect timeline: court's schedule and caseload, whether you request trial or accept a plea deal, complexity of your case (multiple motions, expert witnesses, etc.), and prosecutor's workload and willingness to negotiate. License suspension begins immediately: Even though your criminal case may take months, your license suspension (or restriction) begins immediately after arrest unless you win your administrative hearing."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can a first offense OWI be reduced or expunged in Michigan?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Reduced charges: Yes, often possible through negotiation. We frequently negotiate first offense OWI charges down to lesser offenses: OWVI (Operating While Visibly Impaired) with significantly reduced penalties (90-day license restriction vs 180 days, $300 max fine vs $500, 4 points vs 6 points), or Reckless Driving (non-alcohol traffic offense with no DUI on record, no mandatory license suspension). Expungement: Yes, but with limitations. Michigan law now allows you to expunge (set aside) a first offense OWI conviction, but only if: it's been 5 years since you completed your sentence (probation, fines, etc.), it was your only OWI conviction (first and only drunk driving offense), you have no more than one other felony and two other misdemeanors on your record, and you petition the court and the judge grants the expungement. Important notes about expungement: The conviction will still appear on Secretary of State driving records, it will still count as a first offense for purposes of any future DUI charges, but it will NOT appear on most public background checks, making it easier to find employment and housing."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "What if I'm under 21 and charged with first offense OWI?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "If you're under 21, Michigan's Zero Tolerance law may apply instead of standard OWI. Zero Tolerance Law (MCL 257.625(6)): Drivers under 21 can be charged with having a BAC of just 0.02% or higher—that's one-quarter of the adult limit. This means even one drink can result in criminal charges. Zero Tolerance penalties (first offense): fine up to $250, community service up to 360 hours, license suspended 30 days then restricted 150 days, 4 points on driving record, and substance abuse screening. However, if your BAC is 0.08% or higher, you're charged with regular OWI (even though you're under 21), which carries harsher penalties. Collateral consequences for students: university disciplinary proceedings (separate from criminal court), risk of housing loss or suspension, scholarship loss (athletic, academic, or merit-based), and future impacts on grad school applications and professional licensing."}}
