                <p class="text-align-center sub-headline">Second OWI = Mandatory 5 days jail, 1-year license revocation. Third OWI = Felony with 1-5 years prison. The stakes are higher—you need aggressive defense.</p>
                <p class="text-align-center margin-bottom-lg">If you're facing a <strong>second or third OWI charge</strong>, the penalties are significantly harsher than a first offense. A second OWI means <strong>mandatory minimum jail time</strong>, license revocation (not just suspension), and permanent consequences. A third OWI is a <strong>felony</strong> with prison time, up to 5 years behind bars, and a 5-year license revocation with no guarantee of reinstatement. Prosecutors take repeat offenses seriously—but defenses still exist. An experienced attorney can challenge the evidence, negotiate for treatment-based alternatives, and fight to minimize the devastating impact on your life.</p>

                <h2>Second Offense OWI: What You're Facing</h2>
                <p>A second OWI within 7 years of your first conviction results in significantly enhanced penalties:</p>

                <h3>Criminal Penalties</h3>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li><strong>Mandatory minimum 5 days in jail</strong> (or 30 days of community service as alternative)</li>
                    <li><strong>Up to 1 year in county jail</strong> (judges often impose 30-90 days for second offenses)</li>
                    <li><strong>Fines of $200 to $1,000</strong> plus court costs and fees</li>
                    <li><strong>Probation for 12-36 months</strong> with strict conditions</li>
                    <li><strong>Mandatory substance abuse treatment</strong> (often 6-12 months of intensive outpatient or inpatient programs)</li>
                    <li><strong>Random drug and alcohol testing</strong> throughout probation</li>
                    <li><strong>Possible electronic monitoring (tether)</strong> instead of jail</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>License Revocation (Not Suspension)</h3>
                <p>Your driver's license is <strong>revoked for 1 year minimum</strong>. This is different from a suspension:</p>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li><strong>No driving for ANY reason</strong> for at least 1 year</li>
                    <li><strong>No restricted license available</strong> during the first year</li>
                    <li>After 1 year, you must petition the Secretary of State for reinstatement</li>
                    <li>Reinstatement is NOT automatic—you must prove you're eligible</li>
                    <li>Secretary of State may deny reinstatement and extend revocation</li>
                    <li>If granted, you'll likely be required to install an ignition interlock device</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Vehicle Penalties</h3>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li><strong>Vehicle immobilization for 90-180 days</strong> (license plates confiscated)</li>
                    <li>Possible vehicle forfeiture (permanent loss of your car)</li>
                    <li>You pay for immobilization and storage costs</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Additional Consequences</h3>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li><strong>Driver Responsibility Fee:</strong> $1,000 per year for 2 years ($2,000 total)</li>
                    <li><strong>SR-22 insurance:</strong> High-risk insurance required for 3-5 years after reinstatement</li>
                    <li><strong>Insurance rate increases:</strong> Expect 3-5x higher premiums</li>
                    <li><strong>Employment consequences:</strong> Background checks will show misdemeanor conviction</li>
                    <li><strong>Professional license impact:</strong> Nurses, teachers, lawyers must report to licensing boards</li>
                    <li><strong>Immigration consequences:</strong> Two OWI convictions can trigger deportation proceedings</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="callout"><strong>Total Cost:</strong> A second OWI typically costs $15,000 to $30,000 when you include fines, attorney fees, treatment, lost wages, and increased insurance over 5 years.</p>

        <!-- Third Offense Details -->
        <section class="section_content padding-top-xl padding-bottom-xl">
            <div class="container container_narrow">
                <h2>Third Offense OWI: Felony with Prison Time</h2>
                <p>A third OWI conviction <strong>within your lifetime</strong> (not just within 7 years) is a <strong>felony</strong> punishable by prison time. This is a life-altering conviction.</p>

                <h3>Criminal Penalties</h3>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li><strong>Felony conviction</strong> on your permanent record</li>
                    <li><strong>1 to 5 years in state prison</strong> (most defendants receive 1-3 years)</li>
                    <li><strong>Fines of $500 to $5,000</strong> plus court costs</li>
                    <li><strong>Probation for 3-5 years after prison release</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Mandatory long-term substance abuse treatment</strong> (residential treatment likely)</li>
                    <li><strong>Loss of voting rights while incarcerated</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Loss of right to possess firearms</strong> (federal law)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5-Year License Revocation</h3>
                <p>Your driver's license is <strong>revoked for 5 years minimum</strong>:</p>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li><strong>Absolute prohibition on driving for 5 years</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>No restricted license</strong> during the 5-year period</li>
                    <li>After 5 years, you must petition the Secretary of State Driver Assessment and Appeal Division (DAAD)</li>
                    <li>You must prove by "clear and convincing evidence" that you're no longer a risk</li>
                    <li><strong>Reinstatement is NOT guaranteed</strong>—many petitions are denied</li>
                    <li>If granted, <strong>mandatory ignition interlock device</strong> for at least 1 year (often longer)</li>
                    <li>Restricted license only initially (work, school, treatment only)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Vehicle Forfeiture (Permanent)</h3>
                <p>For third offense OWI, the court will likely order <strong>permanent vehicle forfeiture</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You lose your vehicle permanently—it's sold at auction</li>
                    <li>Even if the vehicle is financed, you lose it (and still owe the loan)</li>
                    <li>If someone else owns the vehicle (spouse, parent), they may challenge forfeiture</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Life as a Felon</h3>
                <p>A felony OWI conviction has consequences far beyond jail and license revocation:</p>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li><strong>Employment:</strong> Felons face extreme difficulty finding jobs. Many employers automatically reject felony applicants.</li>
                    <li><strong>Housing:</strong> Landlords can deny rental applications based on felony convictions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Professional licenses:</strong> Doctors, nurses, lawyers, teachers, and others will likely lose their licenses permanently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Federal benefits:</strong> May lose eligibility for student loans, public housing, food assistance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Firearm prohibition:</strong> Felons cannot possess firearms under federal law.</li>
                    <li><strong>Voting rights:</strong> Cannot vote while incarcerated (reinstated upon release in Michigan).</li>
                    <li><strong>Immigration:</strong> Non-citizens face almost certain deportation for felony convictions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Travel:</strong> Canada and many other countries deny entry to individuals with felony convictions.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="callout"><strong>Total Cost:</strong> A third offense OWI can cost $50,000 to $100,000+ when you include attorney fees, fines, lost wages during incarceration, treatment costs, and long-term employment impacts.</p>

                <h3>Habitual Offender Enhancement</h3>
                <p>If you have prior felony convictions (not just OWI), the prosecutor can charge you as a <strong>habitual offender</strong>, which increases the maximum sentence to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Second habitual offender:</strong> Up to 7.5 years prison</li>
                    <li><strong>Third habitual offender:</strong> Up to 10 years prison</li>
                    <li><strong>Fourth habitual offender:</strong> Up to 15 years prison</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Defense Strategies for Second and Third Offense OWI</h2>
                <p>Prosecutors and judges take repeat OWI offenses very seriously—but <strong>defenses still exist</strong>. Here's how we fight for clients with prior convictions:</p>

                <h3>1. Challenge the Current Arrest (Just Like a First Offense)</h3>
                <p>The prosecution must prove <strong>this specific charge</strong> beyond a reasonable doubt. Your prior convictions don't change that. We attack the current case by:</p>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li><strong>Challenging the traffic stop:</strong> If the stop was illegal, all evidence is suppressed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Challenging breathalyzer accuracy:</strong> Calibration errors, medical conditions, rising BAC defense.</li>
                    <li><strong>Challenging field sobriety tests:</strong> Medical conditions, weather, officer errors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proving constitutional violations:</strong> Miranda violations, illegal search, lack of probable cause.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>If we win dismissal of the current charge, you avoid enhanced penalties entirely.</strong></p>

                <h3>2. Challenge the Prior Convictions</h3>
                <p>To enhance your sentence based on prior OWI convictions, the prosecutor must prove those priors are valid. We can challenge prior convictions by:</p>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li><strong>Proving the prior conviction is too old:</strong> Michigan uses a "lifetime lookback" for third offenses, but second offense enhancements only apply if the prior is within 7 years.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proving the prior conviction was invalid:</strong> If you weren't properly advised of your rights, had ineffective counsel, or the plea was involuntary, we can challenge it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proving the prior wasn't an OWI:</strong> If the prior was OWVI, zero tolerance, or an out-of-state offense that doesn't qualify as OWI under Michigan law.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Successfully challenging even one prior conviction can reduce a felony third offense to a misdemeanor second offense—or a second offense to a first offense.</p>

                <h3>3. Negotiate for Treatment-Based Alternatives</h3>
                <p>For clients struggling with alcohol use disorder, we present evidence of treatment and sobriety to negotiate alternatives to incarceration:</p>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li><strong>Sobriety Court / Drug Court:</strong> Intensive supervision, treatment, and testing in exchange for reduced or deferred sentences. Successfully completing the program can result in reduced charges or dismissed cases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inpatient treatment in lieu of jail:</strong> Judges may allow defendants to complete residential treatment programs instead of serving jail time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Electronic monitoring (tether):</strong> House arrest with alcohol monitoring instead of jail.</li>
                    <li><strong>Work release programs:</strong> Serve jail time on weekends while maintaining employment during the week.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Present Mitigating Factors to Minimize Sentencing</h3>
                <p>If conviction is unavoidable, we present evidence to convince the judge to impose the minimum sentence:</p>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li><strong>Proactive enrollment in treatment:</strong> Starting AA, therapy, or inpatient treatment before sentencing shows commitment to change.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sobriety since arrest:</strong> Maintaining sobriety (with testing to prove it) demonstrates you're addressing the problem.</li>
                    <li><strong>Employment and family responsibilities:</strong> Letters from employers, proof of dependents who rely on you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mental health treatment:</strong> Evidence that you're addressing underlying issues (depression, PTSD, trauma).</li>
                    <li><strong>Community support:</strong> Letters from family, clergy, sponsors, therapists showing you have a strong support system.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Argue Against Vehicle Forfeiture</h3>
                <p>For third offenses, the prosecutor will seek permanent vehicle forfeiture. We can challenge this by:</p>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li><strong>Proving someone else owns the vehicle:</strong> If your spouse, parent, or lender owns it, they can intervene to stop forfeiture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proving forfeiture is disproportionate:</strong> Excessive fine argument under the Eighth Amendment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proving you need the vehicle for treatment:</strong> Showing that losing transportation prevents you from attending court-ordered treatment.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6. Fight for Jury Trial</h3>
                <p>Second and third offense OWI cases are triable to a jury. If the evidence is weak, we take your case to trial and force the prosecution to prove every element beyond a reasonable doubt. We've won acquittals for repeat offenders by:</p>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li>Exposing breathalyzer inaccuracies</li>
                    <li>Proving the traffic stop was illegal</li>
                    <li>Demonstrating that field sobriety tests were improperly administered</li>
                    <li>Showing the officer lacked probable cause to arrest</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="callout"><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Even with prior convictions, you still have rights. An experienced attorney can challenge the evidence, negotiate for treatment alternatives, and fight to minimize the devastating consequences of a repeat OWI.</p>

                <h2>Addressing the Underlying Issue: Alcohol Use Disorder</h2>
                <p>If you're facing a second or third OWI, there's a good chance you're struggling with alcohol use disorder. We're not here to judge—we're here to help you get the treatment you need while protecting your legal rights.</p>

                <h3>Proactive Treatment Strengthens Your Defense</h3>
                <p>Enrolling in treatment <strong>before your court date</strong> demonstrates to prosecutors and judges that you're taking responsibility and addressing the problem. This can result in:</p>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li>Reduced charges (third offense to second, second to first)</li>
                    <li>Reduced jail time (treatment in lieu of incarceration)</li>
                    <li>Admission to Sobriety Court / Drug Court programs</li>

                <h3>Treatment Options We Recommend</h3>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li><strong>Alcoholics Anonymous (AA):</strong> Free peer support meetings. Get a sponsor and start attending daily.</li>
                    <li><strong>Outpatient treatment:</strong> Counseling and group therapy 2-3 times per week.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP):</strong> 9-12 hours per week of structured treatment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inpatient / Residential treatment:</strong> 30-90 day programs for severe addiction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT):</strong> Naltrexone or Acamprosate to reduce cravings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mental health counseling:</strong> Addressing underlying depression, anxiety, or trauma.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>We Work With Treatment Providers</h3>
                <p>We partner with local substance abuse treatment centers and can refer you to programs that will work with your schedule and financial situation. Many programs offer:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sliding scale fees based on income</li>
                    <li>Medicaid and insurance acceptance</li>

                <p>Getting into treatment immediately shows the court you're serious about change—and it can make the difference between prison and probation.</p>

        <section class="section_alternate padding-top-xl padding-bottom-xl">
            <div class="container container_narrow">
                <h2>What to Do After a Second or Third OWI Arrest</h2>

                <h3>Step 1: Hire an Experienced OWI Attorney IMMEDIATELY</h3>
                <p>With enhanced penalties on the line—mandatory jail, felony conviction, prison time—you cannot afford to go without experienced representation. You need an attorney who:</p>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li>Has experience with repeat OWI cases and understands sentencing guidelines</li>
                    <li>Knows how to challenge prior convictions</li>
                    <li>Has relationships with local treatment providers and Sobriety Court programs</li>
                    <li>Has trial experience and isn't afraid to fight for you</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Step 2: Enroll in Treatment Immediately</h3>
                <p>Don't wait for the court to order treatment. Start NOW:</p>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li>Attend AA meetings daily (get attendance slips signed)</li>
                    <li>Get a substance abuse evaluation</li>
                    <li>Enroll in outpatient treatment or IOP</li>
                    <li>Consider inpatient treatment if your addiction is severe</li>
                    <li>Get mental health counseling to address underlying issues</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Bring proof of treatment completion to court. This can be the difference between prison and probation.</p>

                <h3>Step 3: Maintain Complete Sobriety</h3>
                <p>If you're on bond, you will likely be subject to random alcohol and drug testing. <strong>Any positive test will result in bond revocation and immediate jail.</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not consume any alcohol</li>
                    <li>Do not use any drugs (including marijuana—even if you have a medical card)</li>
                    <li>Avoid using mouthwash, cough syrup, or other products containing alcohol</li>
                    <li>Keep records of your sobriety (AA attendance, testing results)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Step 4: Request a License Hearing Within 14 Days</h3>
                <p>You have <strong>14 days</strong> to request an administrative hearing to challenge your license revocation. Call the Michigan Secretary of State at <strong>(888) 767-6424</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Winning the hearing may temporarily save your license, but if you're later convicted, your license will be revoked anyway.</p>

                <h3>Step 5: Do NOT Talk to Police Without an Attorney</h3>
                <p>Invoke your Fifth Amendment right to remain silent:</p>
                <p><em>"I'm invoking my right to remain silent and would like to speak to an attorney."</em></p>
                <p>Do not answer questions about where you were drinking, how much you drank, or whether you knew you were intoxicated. Anything you say will be used against you.</p>

                <h3>Step 6: Comply With All Bond Conditions</h3>
                <p>For repeat offenders, bond conditions are strict:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Attend all court dates</li>
                    <li>Submit to random drug and alcohol testing</li>
                    <li>Do not consume alcohol or drugs</li>
                    <li>Do not drive without a valid license</li>
                    <li>Stay away from bars and liquor stores</li>
                    <li>Wear a GPS tether or alcohol monitoring bracelet if ordered</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Violating bond conditions will result in immediate arrest and jail until trial.</strong></p>

                <h3>Former Public Defender with Hundreds of OWI Cases</h3>
                <p>Attorney Sorin Panainte spent years as a public defender representing clients facing second and third offense OWI charges. He's defended clients facing prison time and successfully negotiated treatment-based alternatives, reduced sentences, and even dismissals.</p>

                <h3>We Understand Addiction—Not Just Law</h3>
                <p>We know that repeat OWI charges are often symptoms of underlying alcohol use disorder, mental health struggles, or trauma. We don't judge—we fight for your legal rights while connecting you with the treatment resources you need.</p>

                <h3>We Challenge Prior Convictions</h3>
                <p>Many attorneys accept prior convictions as fact. We don't. We investigate prior convictions to determine if they're legally valid and challengeable. Successfully invalidating even one prior can reduce a felony to a misdemeanor.</p>

                <h3>Aggressive Trial Representation</h3>
                <p>If the prosecutor won't offer a fair deal, we take your case to trial. We've won acquittals for repeat offenders by exposing weak evidence, challenging breathalyzer accuracy, and proving constitutional violations.</p>

                <h3>Treatment-Based Defense Strategies</h3>
                <p>We work closely with Sobriety Court programs, treatment providers, and mental health professionals to present judges with comprehensive treatment plans that offer alternatives to incarceration.</p>

                        <summary>Will I definitely go to jail for a second offense OWI?</summary>
                        <p><strong>Yes, but the length varies.</strong> Michigan law requires a <strong>mandatory minimum of 5 days in jail</strong> for a second offense OWI (or 30 days of community service as an alternative). However, judges typically impose 30-90 days of jail time for second offenses.</p>
                        <p><strong>Alternatives to jail time include:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Electronic monitoring (house arrest with alcohol tether)</li>
                            <li>Work release programs (jail on weekends, work during the week)</li>

                        <summary>Will I go to prison for a third offense OWI?</summary>
                        <p><strong>Likely, but not guaranteed.</strong> A third offense OWI is a felony punishable by <strong>1 to 5 years in state prison</strong>. Most defendants receive 1-3 years of actual prison time.</p>
                        <p><strong>Factors that determine prison vs. probation:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Your BAC level:</strong> Extremely high BAC increases likelihood of prison</li>
                            <li><strong>Accident or injury:</strong> Causing an accident or injury dramatically increases prison likelihood</li>
                            <li><strong>Time between offenses:</strong> If it's been many years since your last offense, you're more likely to receive probation</li>
                            <li><strong>Proactive treatment:</strong> Enrolling in treatment before sentencing can convince judges to impose probation instead of prison</li>
                            <li><strong>Criminal history:</strong> Additional felony convictions (habitual offender status) increase prison time</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We've successfully negotiated probation instead of prison for third offense clients by presenting comprehensive treatment plans and demonstrating commitment to sobriety.</p>

                        <summary>What's the difference between license suspension and revocation?</summary>
                        <p><strong>Suspension:</strong> Temporary removal of driving privileges with automatic reinstatement when the period ends (first offense = 180-day suspension)</p>
                        <p><strong>Revocation:</strong> Permanent cancellation of your driver's license. You must petition the Secretary of State for reinstatement after the revocation period, and reinstatement is NOT automatic.</p>
                        <p><strong>Second offense:</strong> 1-year revocation. After 1 year, you can petition for reinstatement.</p>
                        <p><strong>Third offense:</strong> 5-year revocation. After 5 years, you must appear before the Driver Assessment and Appeal Division (DAAD) and prove by "clear and convincing evidence" that you're no longer a risk. Many petitions are denied.</p>
                        <p>Even after reinstatement, you'll likely be required to use an ignition interlock device and will only receive a restricted license initially.</p>

                        <summary>Can I challenge my prior OWI convictions?</summary>
                        <p><strong>Yes, in some cases.</strong> To enhance your sentence based on prior convictions, the prosecutor must prove those priors are valid. We can challenge prior convictions by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Proving the prior is too old:</strong> Second offense enhancements only apply if the prior conviction was within 7 years (third offense uses lifetime lookback)</li>
                            <li><strong>Proving the prior was invalid:</strong> If you weren't properly advised of your rights, had ineffective counsel, or the plea was involuntary</li>
                            <li><strong>Proving the prior wasn't an OWI:</strong> If it was OWVI, zero tolerance, or an out-of-state offense that doesn't qualify</li>
                            <li><strong>Proving improper sentencing:</strong> If the prior conviction was improperly scored under sentencing guidelines</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Successfully challenging even one prior can reduce a felony third offense to a misdemeanor second offense—or eliminate enhanced penalties entirely.</p>

                        <summary>What is Sobriety Court and can it help me avoid jail?</summary>
                        <p><strong>Sobriety Court (also called DUI Court or Drug Court)</strong> is an intensive supervision and treatment program for repeat OWI offenders struggling with alcohol use disorder. Instead of jail or prison, participants receive:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Regular court appearances before a dedicated judge</li>
                            <li>Intensive outpatient treatment (3-5 times per week)</li>
                            <li>Random drug and alcohol testing (multiple times per week)</li>
                            <li>Case management and peer support</li>
                            <li>Graduated sanctions for violations (increased testing, community service, short jail stays)</li>
                            <li>Incentives for compliance (reduced supervision, graduation ceremony)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Benefits of Sobriety Court:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Avoid jail or prison time</li>
                            <li>Possibility of reduced charges upon successful completion</li>
                            <li>Comprehensive treatment and support for recovery</li>
                            <li>Maintain employment and family connections</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Requirements:</strong> You must admit you have a substance abuse problem, plead guilty or no contest, and commit to the program (typically 12-18 months). Not all counties offer Sobriety Court, and not all defendants qualify.</p>

                        <p><strong>Likely, but not guaranteed.</strong> For third offense OWI, Michigan law allows the court to order <strong>permanent vehicle forfeiture</strong>—meaning you lose your car forever and it's sold at auction.</p>
                        <p><strong>Defenses against forfeiture:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Someone else owns the vehicle:</strong> If your spouse, parent, or lender owns the vehicle, they can intervene to challenge forfeiture.</li>
                            <li><strong>Forfeiture is disproportionate:</strong> We can argue that permanent loss of your vehicle is an excessive fine under the Eighth Amendment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Need vehicle for treatment:</strong> You can argue that losing transportation prevents you from attending court-ordered treatment and employment.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Even if forfeiture is ordered, an experienced attorney can sometimes negotiate for vehicle immobilization instead of permanent forfeiture.</p>

                        <summary>Should I just plead guilty to get it over with?</summary>
                        <p><strong>Absolutely not.</strong> Pleading guilty to a repeat OWI without consulting an attorney is one of the worst decisions you can make. Here's why:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>You give up all defenses:</strong> You may have valid defenses (illegal stop, breathalyzer errors, invalid priors) that could result in dismissal or reduced charges</li>
                            <li><strong>Enhanced penalties are mandatory:</strong> Once you plead guilty to a second or third offense, the judge MUST impose enhanced penalties</li>
                            <li><strong>No negotiation:</strong> You lose all bargaining power to negotiate reduced charges or treatment alternatives</li>
                            <li><strong>Permanent consequences:</strong> A felony conviction is permanent and will destroy employment opportunities</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Always consult with an attorney first.</strong> Even if you think the case is hopeless, an experienced lawyer can often find defenses or negotiate better outcomes than you could on your own.</p>

                "text": "Attorney fees for repeat OWI defense typically range from $5,000 to $15,000+ depending on whether it's a second or third offense, complexity of the case, and whether it goes to trial. Why the investment is worth it: For second offense, avoid mandatory jail time, preserve your license, negotiate treatment alternatives. For third offense, avoid 1-5 years in prison, fight felony conviction, challenge prior convictions, negotiate probation instead of prison. Cost of NOT hiring an experienced attorney includes: Felony conviction (permanent), Prison time (1-5 years), 5-year license revocation, Permanent loss of employment opportunities, Total cost: $50,000 to $100,000+ in lost income, fines, and long-term consequences. We offer free consultations and payment plans. Call (616) 227-3303 to discuss your case and fees."

                "text": "Absolutely not. Pleading guilty to a repeat OWI without consulting an attorney is one of the worst decisions you can make. Here's why: You give up all defenses (you may have valid defenses like illegal stop, breathalyzer errors, invalid priors that could result in dismissal or reduced charges), Enhanced penalties are mandatory (once you plead guilty to a second or third offense, the judge MUST impose enhanced penalties), No negotiation (you lose all bargaining power to negotiate reduced charges or treatment alternatives), and Permanent consequences (a felony conviction is permanent and will destroy employment opportunities). Always consult with an attorney first. Even if you think the case is hopeless, an experienced lawyer can often find defenses or negotiate better outcomes than you could on your own. We offer free consultations. Call (616) 227-3303 before making any decisions about your case."
