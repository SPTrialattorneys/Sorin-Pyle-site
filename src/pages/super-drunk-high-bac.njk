                <p class="text-align-center sub-headline">0.17% BAC = Nearly DOUBLE the standard OWI penalties. Here's what you're facing—and how to fight back.</p>
                <p class="text-align-center margin-bottom-lg">If you were arrested with a blood alcohol content (BAC) of <strong>0.17% or higher</strong>, you're facing Michigan's "Super Drunk" law—and the penalties are significantly harsher than a standard OWI. You're looking at <strong>up to 180 days in jail</strong> (compared to 93 days), <strong>mandatory ignition interlock</strong>, and a <strong>1-year driver's license suspension</strong> with no restricted license for 45 days. The good news? An experienced OWI attorney can challenge these charges and potentially reduce or dismiss them.</p>

                <h2>What is Michigan's "Super Drunk" Law?</h2>
                <p>Michigan's <strong>Super Drunk law (MCL 257.625(1)(c))</strong> went into effect in 2010 and targets drivers with a BAC of <strong>0.17% or higher</strong>—more than twice the legal limit of 0.08%.</p>

                <p>The law was created because legislators believed that drivers with extremely high BAC levels pose a significantly greater danger to public safety. As a result, they created enhanced penalties that include:</p>

                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li><strong>Up to 180 days in jail</strong> (compared to 93 days for standard OWI)</li>
                    <li><strong>Fines of $200 to $700</strong> (compared to $100-$500)</li>
                    <li><strong>Up to 360 hours of community service</strong> (compared to 45 hours)</li>
                    <li><strong>Mandatory ignition interlock device</strong> for at least 1 year</li>
                    <li><strong>1-year driver's license suspension</strong> (45 days absolute, then restricted with interlock)</li>
                    <li><strong>6 points on your driving record</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Possible vehicle immobilization</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Substance abuse screening and treatment</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>The official charge:</strong> "Operating While Intoxicated with a BAC of 0.17% or More" or "OWI High BAC" (commonly called "Super Drunk").</p>

                <p class="callout"><strong>Important:</strong> Super Drunk is still a <em>misdemeanor</em> for a first offense. It only becomes a felony on your third offense.</p>

        <!-- What is an Ignition Interlock Device? -->
        <section class="section_content padding-top-xl padding-bottom-xl">
            <div class="container container_narrow">
                <h2>What is an Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID)?</h2>
                <p>If you're convicted of Super Drunk, you'll be <strong>required to install a Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID)</strong> in your vehicle for at least 1 year. This is not optional—it's mandatory under Michigan law.</p>

                <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
                <p>An ignition interlock device is a small breathalyzer installed in your car that's wired to your ignition system. Before you can start your vehicle, you must blow into the device. If it detects alcohol on your breath, your car won't start.</p>

                <h3>Key Features:</h3>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li><strong>Random "rolling retests":</strong> While driving, the device will periodically require you to provide another breath sample. If you fail or don't respond, your horn will honk and lights will flash until you turn off the engine.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data recording:</strong> The device logs every test, every failed attempt, and every time you try to start your car. This data is downloaded monthly and submitted to the court.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tampering detection:</strong> Attempting to bypass, disable, or tamper with the device is a separate crime that can result in additional charges.</li>
                    <li><strong>Calibration appointments:</strong> You must bring your vehicle in for monthly calibration and data downloads—missing an appointment can result in violations.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Cost of Ignition Interlock:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Installation:</strong> $75-$150</li>
                    <li><strong>Monthly monitoring fee:</strong> $60-$90/month</li>
                    <li><strong>Removal fee:</strong> $50-$100</li>
                    <li><strong>Total for 1 year:</strong> $900-$1,300</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Important:</strong> You pay for the ignition interlock device yourself. The court does not cover this cost.</p>

                <h3>Violations and Consequences:</h3>
                <p>If you test positive for alcohol, miss a rolling retest, or tamper with the device, the court will be notified. Consequences include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extension of your interlock requirement (additional months or years)</li>
                    <li>Additional fines and fees</li>
                    <li>Probation violation (jail time)</li>
                    <li>Revocation of your restricted license</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="callout"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Even mouthwash, hand sanitizer, or certain foods can trigger a false positive. Always rinse your mouth with water before testing, and avoid using alcohol-based products.</p>

        <!-- License Suspension Details -->

            <div class="container container_narrow">
                <h2>Driver's License Suspension: What to Expect</h2>
                <p>A Super Drunk conviction results in a <strong>1-year driver's license suspension</strong>. Here's how it breaks down:</p>

                <h3>45-Day "Hard Suspension" (No Driving at All)</h3>
                <p>For the first 45 days, your license is <strong>completely suspended</strong>—you cannot drive for <em>any reason</em>, including work, school, or medical appointments. This is called an "absolute suspension."</p>

                <h3>Restricted License with Ignition Interlock (After 45 Days)</h3>
                <p>After the 45-day absolute suspension, you can apply for a <strong>restricted license</strong> that allows you to drive for:</p>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li>Work or job search</li>
                    <li>School or college classes</li>
                    <li>Medical appointments (yours or immediate family)</li>
                    <li>Court-ordered probation activities (counseling, community service)</li>
                    <li>Alcohol or drug treatment programs</li>
                    <li>Grocery shopping and essential errands (limited)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>But here's the catch:</strong> Your restricted license is <strong>only valid if you have an ignition interlock device installed in your vehicle</strong>. Without it, you cannot legally drive—even with a restricted license.</p>

                <h3>Full License Reinstatement (After 1 Year)</h3>
                <p>After the full 1-year suspension period, you can apply for <strong>full license reinstatement</strong>. However, you'll likely be required to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Complete all court-ordered requirements (fines, community service, treatment)</li>
                    <li>Pay a $125 reinstatement fee</li>
                    <li>Keep the ignition interlock device installed for an additional period (court decides length)</li>
                    <li>Provide proof of insurance (SR-22 form)</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="callout"><strong>Secretary of State Hearing:</strong> If you have multiple offenses or violations during your suspension, you may need to attend a <strong>driver's license appeal hearing</strong> at the Secretary of State to prove you're eligible for reinstatement.</p>

                <h2>Real-World Consequences Beyond Court Penalties</h2>
                <p>A Super Drunk conviction affects far more than just your legal record. Here's what you're really facing:</p>

                <h3>Employment Impact</h3>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">

                </ul>

                <h3>Financial Impact</h3>

                    <li><strong>Lost wages:</strong> Jail time, court dates, license suspension</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Personal and Family Impact</h3>

        <!-- Defenses to Super Drunk Charges -->
        <section class="section_alternate padding-top-xl padding-bottom-xl">
            <div class="container container_narrow">
                <h2>How to Fight Super Drunk Charges: Common Defenses</h2>
                <p>Just because you were arrested with a BAC of 0.17% or higher doesn't mean you'll automatically be convicted. An experienced OWI attorney can challenge the evidence and potentially get your charges reduced or dismissed. Here are the most effective defenses:</p>

                <h3>1. Challenge the Traffic Stop (Fourth Amendment)</h3>
                <p>Police need <strong>reasonable suspicion</strong> to pull you over. If the officer stopped you without valid reason, <em>all evidence</em> obtained after the stop (including your breath test) can be suppressed.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples of illegal stops:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Officer claims you were "swerving" but dashcam shows normal driving</li>
                    <li>Anonymous tip without corroboration</li>
                    <li>Pulling you over for an expired registration tab that was actually current</li>
                    <li>Stopping you at a sobriety checkpoint that doesn't meet legal requirements</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Challenge the Breathalyzer Results</h3>
                <p>Michigan's DataMaster breathalyzer is not infallible. There are several ways to challenge the accuracy of your breath test:</p>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li><strong>Device not properly calibrated:</strong> Breathalyzers must be calibrated and maintained according to strict protocols. We subpoena maintenance records to check for missed calibrations or errors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Operator error:</strong> The officer administering the test must be certified and follow proper procedures. Mistakes in administration can invalidate the results.</li>
                    <li><strong>Medical conditions:</strong> GERD, acid reflux, diabetes (ketoacidosis), and certain diets (keto) can cause falsely high BAC readings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mouth alcohol contamination:</strong> Recent vomiting, burping, or using mouthwash can cause residual alcohol in your mouth, leading to inflated readings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Radio frequency interference (RFI):</strong> Cell phones, police radios, and other electronic devices can interfere with breath test accuracy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Temperature issues:</strong> Body temperature, room temperature, and breath temperature all affect BAC readings. A fever can increase your BAC reading by up to 8%.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Challenge the Field Sobriety Tests</h3>
                <p>Field sobriety tests (FSTs) are <strong>subjective</strong> and notoriously unreliable. Factors that affect performance include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Medical conditions (knee injuries, back problems, inner ear issues)</li>
                    <li>Age (people over 65 struggle with balance tests)</li>
                    <li>Footwear (high heels, work boots)</li>
                    <li>Weather and road conditions (ice, uneven pavement)</li>
                    <li>Nervousness and anxiety</li>
                    <li>Officer instructions were unclear or incorrect</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Argue Improper BAC "Rising Curve"</h3>
                <p>Your BAC continues to <strong>rise for 30-90 minutes after you stop drinking</strong>. If you were stopped shortly after leaving a bar, your BAC may have been below 0.17% while driving but rose above that level by the time you were tested at the police station.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> You left the bar at 11:45 PM with a BAC of 0.15%. You were stopped at 11:55 PM. By the time you were tested at the station at 12:30 AM, your BAC had risen to 0.18%.</p>
                <p><strong>Legal argument:</strong> Your BAC was below 0.17% <em>at the time of driving</em>, so the Super Drunk charge doesn't apply. We can use retrograde extrapolation to calculate your BAC at the time of driving.</p>

                <h3>5. Negotiate a Reduction to Standard OWI</h3>
                <p>Even if the evidence against you is strong, an experienced attorney can often negotiate with the prosecutor to <strong>reduce your Super Drunk charge to a standard OWI</strong>. This means:</p>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li>Maximum 93 days jail instead of 180 days</li>
                    <li>Lower fines ($100-$500 vs. $200-$700)</li>
                    <li>Shorter license suspension (180 days vs. 1 year)</li>
                    <li><strong>No mandatory ignition interlock</strong></li>
                    <li>45 hours community service instead of 360 hours</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6. Pursue Reduction to Standard OWI or OWVI</h3>
                <p>If this is your <strong>first offense</strong>, one of the most valuable outcomes is <strong>reducing your Super Drunk charge to standard OWI</strong>—or potentially further reducing it to OWVI (Operating While Visibly Impaired).</p>

                <p><strong>Two-step reduction strategy:</strong></p>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li><strong>Step 1: Super Drunk to standard OWI:</strong> Eliminates mandatory ignition interlock, reduces maximum jail from 180 to 93 days, shortens license suspension from 1 year to 180 days</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2: Standard OWI to OWVI:</strong> Further reduces penalties (90-day license restriction, $300 max fine, 4 points instead of 6), resulting in a significantly lesser conviction on your record</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Eligibility for reduction:</strong> Must be your first offense (no prior alcohol-related offenses), strong mitigating factors (proactive treatment enrollment, employment, family responsibilities), and prosecutor/judge agreement.</p>

                <p class="callout"><strong>Strategy:</strong> An experienced attorney can present compelling mitigating factors to persuade prosecutors to reduce Super Drunk charges. Proactive enrollment in alcohol treatment significantly strengthens your negotiating position.</p>

        <!-- What to Do After Arrest -->
        <section class="section_content padding-top-xl padding-bottom-xl">
            <div class="container container_narrow">
                <h2>What to Do After a Super Drunk Arrest</h2>
                <p>If you've been arrested for Super Drunk (0.17% BAC or higher), here's what you need to do immediately:</p>

                <h3>Step 1: Request a License Hearing (You Have 14 Days)</h3>
                <p>When you're arrested for OWI, the police will confiscate your driver's license and give you a <strong>temporary paper permit</strong> valid for 14 days. After 14 days, your license will be automatically suspended—<em>unless</em> you request a hearing with the Secretary of State.</p>
                <p><strong>Action Required:</strong> Call the Michigan Secretary of State at <strong>(888) 767-6424</strong> within 14 days to request an <strong>Administrative License Suspension Hearing</strong>. This hearing gives you a chance to challenge the suspension <em>before</em> it takes effect.</p>
                <p class="callout"><strong>Critical Deadline:</strong> If you miss the 14-day deadline, your license will be suspended automatically, and you'll lose your opportunity to challenge it.</p>

                <h3>Step 2: Hire an Experienced OWI Attorney Immediately</h3>
                <p>The sooner you hire an attorney, the more options you'll have. An attorney can:</p>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li>Request and review police reports, dashcam footage, and breath test records</li>
                    <li>Identify weaknesses in the prosecution's case</li>
                    <li>File motions to suppress evidence (if the stop or test was illegal)</li>
                    <li>Negotiate with the prosecutor to reduce your charges (Super Drunk to OWI, or OWI to OWVI)</li>
                    <li>Represent you at the license hearing and in court</li>
                    <li>Present mitigating factors to minimize penalties</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Step 3: Don't Talk to the Police (You Have the Right to Remain Silent)</h3>
                <p>After your arrest, the police may try to question you about where you were drinking, how much you drank, or whether you knew you were over the limit. <strong>Do not answer these questions.</strong></p>
                <p>Politely say: <em>"I'm invoking my right to remain silent and would like to speak to an attorney."</em></p>
                <p>Anything you say can and will be used against you in court—even if you think you're being helpful.</p>

                <h3>Step 4: Document Everything</h3>
                <p>As soon as possible, write down:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What you ate and drank that day (including times)</li>
                    <li>When and where you were pulled over</li>
                    <li>What the officer said and did</li>
                    <li>Any medical conditions or medications you're taking</li>
                    <li>Weather and road conditions</li>
                    <li>Whether you were read your Miranda rights</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These details can help your attorney build a defense.</p>

                <h3>Step 5: Avoid Social Media</h3>
                <p>Prosecutors and police monitor social media. Do not post about your arrest, make jokes about drinking and driving, or share photos of yourself at bars or parties. Anything you post can be used as evidence against you.</p>

                <h3>Step 6: Attend All Court Dates and Comply with Bond Conditions</h3>
                <p>Missing a court date will result in a <strong>bench warrant for your arrest</strong> and additional charges. If you're released on bond, follow all conditions (e.g., no alcohol consumption, drug testing, curfew).</p>

                        <p><strong>Standard OWI:</strong> BAC of 0.08% to 0.16%. Maximum 93 days jail, $100-$500 fine, 180-day license suspension.</p>
                        <p><strong>Super Drunk (High BAC):</strong> BAC of 0.17% or higher. Maximum 180 days jail, $200-$700 fine, 1-year license suspension, and <strong>mandatory ignition interlock device</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Super Drunk carries nearly double the penalties and is treated much more seriously by prosecutors and judges.</p>

                    <details class="faq-item-expandable">
                        <summary>Is Super Drunk a felony or misdemeanor?</summary>
                        <p><strong>First offense:</strong> Misdemeanor</p>
                        <p><strong>Second offense:</strong> Misdemeanor (but penalties increase significantly)</p>
                        <p><strong>Third offense:</strong> <strong>Felony</strong> (up to 5 years in prison)</p>
                        <p>Even though a first offense Super Drunk is "just" a misdemeanor, it still carries serious consequences and will appear on background checks for employment, housing, and professional licensing.</p>

                    <details class="faq-item-expandable">
                        <summary>Can I get a Super Drunk charge reduced to a regular OWI?</summary>
                        <p><strong>Yes, often.</strong> Prosecutors are willing to negotiate plea deals, especially if:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is your first offense</li>
                            <li>There are weaknesses in the prosecution's case (e.g., breathalyzer calibration issues)</li>
                            <li>You've proactively enrolled in alcohol treatment</li>
                            <li>Your attorney presents compelling mitigating factors</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A reduction to standard OWI means you avoid the mandatory ignition interlock requirement, face less jail time, and receive a shorter license suspension.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item-expandable">
                        <summary>How long does a Super Drunk conviction stay on my record?</summary>
                        <p><strong>Forever—unless you get it expunged after 5 years.</strong></p>
                        <p>Michigan law now allows you to <a href="/record-expungement.html">expunge (set aside) OWI and Super Drunk convictions</a>, but only after:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>5 years have passed since you completed your sentence</li>
                            <li>It's your only OWI conviction (first and only drunk driving offense)</li>
                            <li>You meet other eligibility requirements and the judge grants your petition</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Even with expungement, the conviction will still count as a prior offense for future OWI charges and will remain on Secretary of State driving records. However, it won't appear on most public background checks.</p>
                        <p><strong>Better strategy:</strong> Fight for charge reduction or dismissal before conviction. A reduced charge (OWVI or reckless driving) carries significantly lesser penalties and long-term consequences than a Super Drunk conviction.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item-expandable">
                        <summary>What happens if I refuse the breath test?</summary>
                        <p>If you refuse a breathalyzer or blood test, you'll face <strong>automatic penalties under Michigan's Implied Consent Law</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>1-year driver's license suspension</strong> (separate from any criminal penalties)</li>

                            <li>Your refusal can be used as <strong>evidence of guilt</strong> in court ("Why refuse unless you knew you were drunk?")</li>
                            <li>Police can still obtain a warrant to forcibly draw your blood</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Refusing the breath test does NOT guarantee you'll avoid a Super Drunk charge. Police can obtain a warrant for a blood draw, and blood tests are often more accurate than breath tests.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item-expandable">
                        <summary>Will I definitely go to jail for Super Drunk?</summary>
                        <p><strong>Not necessarily.</strong> While Super Drunk allows up to 180 days in jail, most first-time offenders receive:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Probation</strong> (12-24 months)</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Jail time is more likely if:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your BAC was extremely high (0.25%+)</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>An experienced attorney can present mitigating factors (e.g., enrollment in treatment, employment, family responsibilities) to convince the judge that probation is more appropriate than jail.</p>

                        <summary>Can a Super Drunk charge be reduced to avoid a conviction?</summary>
                        <p><strong>Yes, through charge reduction negotiation.</strong> Super Drunk charges can potentially be reduced to standard OWI, or further reduced to OWVI (Operating While Visibly Impaired) or even Reckless Driving in some cases.</p>
                        <p><strong>Reduction strategy:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Negotiate Super Drunk down to standard OWI (eliminates mandatory ignition interlock, reduces jail time from 180 to 93 days, shortens license suspension from 1 year to 180 days)</li>
                            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Further negotiate OWI down to OWVI (90-day license restriction instead of 180 days, $300 max fine instead of $500, 4 points instead of 6, lesser conviction on record)</li>
                            <li><strong>Step 3 (Rare):</strong> In cases with significant weaknesses, negotiate down to Reckless Driving (non-alcohol traffic offense, no mandatory license suspension, no DUI on record)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Your best chances for reduction:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is your first offense (no prior alcohol-related charges)</li>
                            <li>You proactively enrolled in alcohol treatment before court</li>
                            <li>You have strong mitigating factors (employment, family responsibilities, mental health treatment)</li>
                            <li>There are weaknesses in the prosecution's case (calibration issues, improper stop, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Your attorney presents compelling evidence to justify reduction</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>An experienced attorney can identify weaknesses in your case and negotiate the best possible reduction.</p>

                        <p><strong>A Super Drunk conviction means a 1-year CDL suspension—even if you were in your personal vehicle.</strong></p>

Even with expungement, the conviction will still count as a prior offense for future OWI charges and will remain on Secretary of State driving records. However, it won't appear on most public background checks. Better strategy: Fight for charge reduction or dismissal before conviction. A reduced charge (OWVI or reckless driving) carries significantly lesser penalties and long-term consequences than a Super Drunk conviction."
