[Attorney Sorin Panainte](/sorin-panainte.html), founding partner at Sorin & Pyle, was elected Vice President of the Allegan County Bar Association at the organization's meeting on December 3, 2025 in Allegan, Michigan.

Sorin was nominated for the one-year position by a local judge and confirmed unanimously via voice vote. He replaces Michael Becker, who was elected President during the same meeting. Alice Bernal was also elected to serve as Treasurer.

In a moment of unexpected timing, Sorin had recently finished watching the miniseries *Death by Lightning*, which depicts someone being unexpectedly nominated for vice president of their country. While the stakes of a bar association election are considerably different from national politics, the parallel of an unanticipated nomination followed by a vote of confidence from colleagues wasn't lost on him.

## Service to the Legal Community

This leadership role reflects Sorin's ongoing commitment to serving the legal community in West Michigan. As Vice President, he will work alongside bar association leadership to support attorneys practicing in Allegan County and advance the administration of justice throughout the region.

Sorin has been actively involved with the Allegan County courts since beginning his criminal defense practice. He regularly appears in Allegan County Circuit Court and District Court representing clients charged with [DUI](/dui-defense.html), [domestic violence](/domestic-violence-defense.html), and other criminal offenses.

## Professional Background

Sorin is a former Ottawa County Public Defender with extensive trial experience. He graduated cum laude from Case Western Reserve University School of Law in 2019 and earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan in 2016. He is licensed to practice law in Michigan (State Bar P85326).

Sorin also serves as a member of Criminal Defense Attorneys of Michigan (CDAM) and the State Bar of Michigan.
