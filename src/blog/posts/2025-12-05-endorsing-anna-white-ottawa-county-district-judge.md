There were so many people outside the Holland District Court on Thursday morning that I started wondering if the local Department of Public Safety might be concerned. We were all congregated right outside their doors—people of all colors, races, and backgrounds, but with one thing in common: we were there to support Attorney Anna White's decision to run for Ottawa County District Judge.

The Holland Sentinel reporter said they wouldn't be able to take photographs. Luckily, a mentor of ours and close friend, Abraham Gonzales, happened to bring along a fancy camera he'd recently splurged on. "Could be for business purposes too," he told me with a grin, "but mostly I use it for family photos." With his camera ready, the speeches began.

Bob Hamilton went first. He's the former Ottawa County Public Defender who hired both me and my law partner Jonathan when we were fresh out of law school. Bob doesn't give endorsements lightly. He told the crowd that Anna would bring fairness to the bench and how proud he was to be standing there supporting her.

I trust Bob's judgment on people. His leadership shaped the kind of attorney I've become, and when he vouches for someone's character and commitment to fairness, that means something.

Anna worked as a public defender alongside many of us in the criminal defense community. Before law school, she was a social worker—which gives her a perspective on the human side of the justice system that a lot of attorneys don't have. She's seen both sides. She's worked with victims and with people accused of crimes. And I've watched her treat everyone with the same respect and dignity, understanding that every person in that courtroom is going through one of the hardest moments of their life.

Her involvement in the community goes beyond her legal work. She's served on the board of directors for the Fearless Family of Churches, currently serves on the advisory team for Ridge Point Community Church, and sits on the Ottawa County Community Corrections Advisory Board. For the past two years, she's been board president of Compassion Heart Ministries.

In her speech, Anna said something that stuck with me: "The justice system has a significant impact on the lives of individuals and families. I believe every person deserves to be treated with dignity and to have their case considered carefully and fairly. My goal is to bring both expertise and empathy to every decision."

That's not a campaign line. That's who she is.

The 58th District Court handles thousands of cases every year—[DUI charges](/dui-defense.html), [domestic violence](/domestic-violence-defense.html), misdemeanors, civil disputes. These aren't just docket numbers. They're people's lives. Families. Futures. The judge who sits on that bench will have an enormous impact on our community for the next six years.

Judge Bradley Knoll can't run again due to age limitations. The seat opens up in November 2026, and the decision Ottawa County makes matters.

After Anna finished speaking, people stuck around to sign up as volunteers and add their names to the endorsement list. There were multiple pages of volunteers. I grabbed signs for both my driveway and my office. Unfortunately, they ran out of signs—there were more people who wanted them than they'd printed.

**I endorse Anna White for Ottawa County District Judge.**

She will bring fairness to the bench. She will follow the rule of law. She will treat people with dignity and respect. I've seen her do it for years, and I trust her to keep doing it as a judge.
