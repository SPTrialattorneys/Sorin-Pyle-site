In criminal defense, a "Not Guilty" verdict is the rarest and most meaningful win. It's the result of months of investigation, sleepless nights, and the relentless dismantling of the prosecution's case. Most attorneys will tell you that the vast majority of cases end in plea agreements, and they're right.

My law partner, [Sorin Panainte](/sorin-panainte.html), recently won three jury acquittals in one week, spanning two counties and hundreds of miles of Michigan highway. In a profession where plea deals are the norm, three straight jury wins is almost unheard of.

## Tuesday, Thursday, Tuesday

We tell every client that we prepare their case for trial, even when the statistics suggest it will end in a negotiated resolution. This streak demonstrated exactly why that preparation matters.

It started on a Tuesday in Allegan County with an assault jury trial. By refusing to accept the narrative offered by the prosecution, Sorin secured an acquittal before the day was over.

Most attorneys would take a breath after a trial win. Instead, Sorin spent Wednesday morning at the office, then got in his car that afternoon for the four-hour drive north to Cheboygan. He didn't just drive—he worked. He called me from the road, rehearsing his opening statement out loud, pressure-testing his theory of the case as the miles ticked by. He'd been working the [domestic violence](/domestic-violence-defense.html) case for months, but he used that windshield time to sharpen his edge before walking into an unfamiliar courtroom.

Less than forty-eight hours after his first verdict, Sorin stood before a jury in Cheboygan Circuit Court on a felony domestic violence charge. The stakes were higher. The venue was new. The result was the same: Not Guilty. Afterward, the presiding judge complimented Sorin's work and said he'd welcome him back in his courtroom anytime. For an out-of-town attorney walking into an unfamiliar court, that kind of recognition doesn't come easy.

And then, to close out the run, he returned to Allegan County District Court the following Tuesday for a third jury trial, a misdemeanor domestic violence case. Once again, the jury came back in our client's favor.

Three trials. Three acquittals. One week.

## Preparation, Not Luck

That kind of streak doesn't happen by accident. There wasn't a single loophole or a lucky break. It came down to a philosophy Sorin applies to every case from the very first meeting.

He listens. That sounds simple, but it's rarer than it should be in criminal defense. Too many attorneys assume their client is guilty and immediately start hunting for a deal. Sorin starts by sitting down, hearing the client's full story, and understanding what actually happened, not what the police report claims happened. Every one of these three clients came to us feeling like the system had already decided their fate. Sorin gave them something they hadn't expected: someone in their corner who took them seriously.

From there, he challenges the official story. Police reports and prosecutor statements are not facts. They are one version of events, constructed by people with their own assumptions and blind spots. Sorin's success in these trials came from a refusal to take the state's word as settled truth. He digs into the details, questions the assumptions, and finds the gaps.

And when the moment comes, he doesn't hesitate. Whether the case is an assault charge ten minutes from the office or a felony domestic violence case requiring a full day of driving, the commitment is the same. If trial is what the case demands, that's where we go.

## Why We Do This

Sorin and I have practiced together for over four years, three of those as public defenders before we started this firm. I know what he's capable of because I've watched him grow into one of the best trial attorneys I've ever worked alongside. During our public defender days, I once won two jury trials in two weeks and three in a month, with Sorin in my corner helping prepare each one. Watching him exceed that record on his own was one of the proudest moments of my career.

The words "Not Guilty" represent the best feeling in this profession. It's what we come back to when the work feels impossible, when the odds seem stacked, when the system feels immovable. Seeing the relief on a client's face, the realization that their life isn't over: that's why we do this work.

If you or someone you love is facing criminal charges, don't assume you're out of options. Don't assume the police report is the final word. [Contact us](/contact.html) or call **(616) 227-3303** for a free consultation. We're ready to listen, we're ready to fight, and if your case needs to go to trial, we're ready for that too.
