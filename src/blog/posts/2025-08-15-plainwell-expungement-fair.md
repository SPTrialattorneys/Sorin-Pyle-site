On August 15, 2025, one of our attorneys proudly joined fellow legal professionals in volunteering at the Free Expungement Fair & Resource Clinic hosted by Christian Neighbors in Plainwell, Michigan. The clinic was presented in partnership with the Allegan Public Defender's Office, the Michigan Attorney General's Office, Safe & Just Michigan, and several community organizations.

The event offered Michigan residents a chance to begin clearing their criminal records of Misdemeanor and Felony convictions—an important step toward greater opportunities in employment, housing, and education. Expungement can be life-changing, and Attorney Sorin is honored to have been part of an effort that directly supports second chances.

## How the Clinic Helped

Volunteer attorneys, including our own, worked alongside community partners to:

- Assist eligible attendees with completing expungement paperwork
- Provide access to volunteer notaries
- Conduct fingerprint scans
- Offer guidance on the next steps after applications were mailed

The event was free to all Michigan residents and drew many individuals seeking a fresh start.

## Why This Work Matters

At Sorin & Pyle, Trial Lawyers, we believe that access to justice shouldn't depend on income. Expungement clinics like this one remove barriers for people who deserve the opportunity to rebuild their lives. By giving back through pro bono work, our attorneys reaffirm the firm's commitment to ensuring fairness and equity in the legal system.

## Looking Ahead

We are proud of the impact that events like the Plainwell clinic have on individuals and families across Michigan. Our firm remains dedicated to supporting community initiatives that empower people to move forward with dignity and confidence.
