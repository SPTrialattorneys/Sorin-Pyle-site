At **Sorin & Pyle**, we believe that justice isn't just found inside a courtroom—it's built in the community. We also know that a past mistake shouldn't define a person's entire future.

That is why we are proud to highlight **Attorney Sorin Panainte's** recent pro bono work at the **Free Expungement Fair** hosted by the **Gun Lake Tribe** in Shelbyville, Michigan.

## Rolling Up Our Sleeves for a Fresh Start

The event, held at the GLT Administration Building, was dedicated to helping community members clear their records and move forward with their lives. For many, a criminal record acts as an invisible barrier, blocking access to better jobs, housing, and educational opportunities.

Sorin Panainte joined other legal professionals to provide free assistance to the public, regardless of tribal affiliation. While the goal was clear, the path to expungement can often be confusing without guidance.

"What stood out to me is a lot of people had applied before or started the process but didn't go through all the way or had missing documents," Sorin noted after the event.

This observation highlights exactly why events like these are critical. The day was filled with hands-on work to bridge that gap between starting the process and actually crossing the finish line, including:

- **Eligibility Checks:** Determining if specific convictions qualified for removal under Michigan's "Clean Slate" laws.
- **Application Assistance:** Helping attendees navigate the complex paperwork that often stalls their progress.
- **Next Steps Guidance:** Explaining the legal path forward after the fair.

## Why Events Like This Matter (And How Expungement Helps)

*You might be asking: "What exactly does an expungement do?"*

In the world of law, **expungement** is the process of sealing a criminal record so it is no longer accessible to the public. This is often referred to as a "Clean Slate."

When our attorneys volunteer at events like the Gun Lake Tribe Expungement Fair, we aren't just filing paperwork; we are helping restore dignity. This was especially evident in the demographics of the attendees.

"What also stood out to me is the amount of elderly people that want to clean up their 'wild teenage years' convictions," Sorin shared.

This serves as a powerful reminder that expungement isn't just about utility—it's about legacy.

**Here is why this work is vital for our Michigan neighbors:**

1. **Employment:** Many employers overlook applicants with records. Expungement opens doors to careers that were previously closed.
2. **Housing:** Landlords frequently run background checks. A clean record makes it easier to find a safe place to live.
3. **Peace of Mind:** Perhaps most importantly, it lifts the weight of the past, allowing individuals—whether they are young adults or grandparents—to walk into the future with confidence.

## A Commitment to Service

We want to extend a thank you to the **Gun Lake Tribe** for hosting such an impactful event and allowing us the opportunity to serve. Their dedication to the community—providing everything from fingerprinting to legal aid—is inspiring.
