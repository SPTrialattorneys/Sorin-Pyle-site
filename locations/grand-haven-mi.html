                <h2>Why Grand Haven Cases Require Experienced Defense</h2>

                <p>Grand Haven isn't just another Ottawa County city—it's the county seat and the location of the Ottawa County courthouse. This means all felony trials for the entire county take place here, and the 20th Circuit Court handles some of the most serious criminal cases in West Michigan. The Ottawa County Prosecutor's Office maintains a strong presence in Grand Haven, and they have significant resources and experienced prosecutors handling cases daily.</p>

                <p>If you're facing charges in Grand Haven, you need attorneys who:</p>

                        <h4>🏛️ Regularly Defend Cases in the 20th Circuit Court</h4>
                        <p>The 20th Circuit Court is where all Ottawa County felonies are tried. Located in Grand Haven, this courthouse handles the most serious criminal charges—drug trafficking, violent felonies, third-offense DUI, weapons offenses, and more. We have extensive trial experience in this court and know the judges' preferences, local procedures, and how to build winning defenses for felony cases.</p>

                    <div class="advantage-item">
                        <h4>⚖️ Know Grand Haven's 58th District Court</h4>
                        <p>The 58th District Court in Grand Haven handles all misdemeanor cases and preliminary examinations for felonies. We appear in this court regularly for arraignments, pretrial conferences, and trials. Our familiarity with the court staff, local prosecutors, and district court judges gives our clients a significant advantage.</p>

                        <h4>🌊 Understand Grand Haven's Unique Environment</h4>
                        <p>Grand Haven is a beach town with seasonal tourism, the famous Coast Guard Festival, and a downtown boardwalk that draws thousands of visitors. This creates unique law enforcement challenges—DUI enforcement increases during summer months, beach parties result in alcohol and drug arrests, and tourist-related incidents lead to assault and disorderly conduct charges. We understand these local dynamics and how they affect your case.</p>

While we're aggressive advocates for our clients, prosecutors know we're reasonable, prepared, and willing to try cases when necessary.

                <h2>Common Criminal Charges in Grand Haven, MI</h2>

                <p>We defend Grand Haven residents and visitors against all types of criminal charges, including:</p>

                <div class="grid_2-col margin-bottom-lg">
                    <div>
                        <h3>DUI / OWI Charges in Grand Haven</h3>
                        <p>Grand Haven police and Ottawa County Sheriff's deputies conduct aggressive DUI enforcement, especially along US-31, Beacon Boulevard, Harbor Drive, and downtown during summer tourist season and Coast Guard Festival. Beach town nightlife and waterfront bars make DUI arrests common. If you've been arrested for drunk driving in Grand Haven, we can challenge breathalyzer results, field sobriety tests, and police procedures. <a href="../dui-defense.html">Learn more about our DUI defense services</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Domestic Violence Arrests</h3>
                        <p>Domestic violence arrests are common in Grand Haven, and Michigan law requires police to arrest someone whenever they respond to domestic disturbance calls. Even if the alleged victim wants charges dropped, prosecutors often proceed anyway. Many cases involve false accusations, exaggerated claims during custody disputes, or situations where both parties were involved but only one gets arrested. We defend against these charges aggressively. <a href="../domestic-violence-defense.html">Learn more about domestic violence defense</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Drug Charges</h3>
                        <p>Ottawa County takes drug offenses seriously, and the Ottawa County Prosecutor's Office prosecutes drug cases aggressively. Whether you're facing possession of marijuana, cocaine, heroin, prescription drugs, or more serious charges like possession with intent to deliver or drug trafficking, we provide experienced defense. Many drug cases involve illegal searches, confidential informants, and questionable police tactics that we can challenge.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Assault & Battery</h3>
                        <p>Bar fights, disputes on the boardwalk, altercations at beach parties, and conflicts during festivals can escalate quickly and result in assault charges. We defend clients by demonstrating self-defense, challenging witness credibility, and negotiating reduced charges to avoid assault convictions.</p>

                        <h3>Tourist-Related Offenses</h3>
                        <p>Grand Haven's tourism brings unique charges: disorderly conduct on the beach, minor in possession (MIP) during Coast Guard Festival, public intoxication, open container violations, and trespassing. We help tourists and residents resolve these charges without permanent criminal records.</p>

                        <h3>Theft & Retail Fraud</h3>
                        <p>Retail fraud (shoplifting) charges from Grand Haven stores, theft from vehicles, and property crimes are prosecuted aggressively. Even first-time offenders face criminal records that follow them for life. We negotiate dismissals, reduced charges, and diversion programs to avoid theft convictions.</p>

                        <h3>Boating Under the Influence (BUI)</h3>
                        <p>Grand Haven's location on Lake Michigan and the Grand River makes boating under the influence arrests common during summer. BUI is treated similarly to DUI, with serious penalties including jail time, fines, and boating restrictions. We defend BUI cases by challenging field sobriety tests, breathalyzer results, and police procedures on the water.</p>

                <p>If Grand Haven police, Ottawa County Sheriff's deputies, or Michigan State Police arrest you, follow these critical steps:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Remain silent.</strong> Do NOT talk to police without a lawyer present. Invoke your right to remain silent immediately: "I am invoking my right to remain silent, and I want to speak with an attorney."</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not consent to searches.</strong> Police may ask to search your car, phone, hotel room, or belongings. Politely say, "I do not consent to any searches."</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not resist arrest.</strong> Even if you believe the arrest is unjust, do not physically resist. Resisting arrest is an additional criminal charge that makes your case significantly worse.</li>
                    <li><strong>Call an attorney immediately.</strong> The sooner we start working on your case, the better. Call us at <strong>(616) 227-3303</strong> as soon as possible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Document everything.</strong> Write down what happened, names of witnesses, officer badge numbers, and any evidence supporting your defense. Take photos of injuries, property damage, or anything relevant to your case.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not post about your case on social media.</strong> Prosecutors will review your Facebook, Instagram, and other social media accounts looking for evidence against you. Anything you post can and will be used against you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Attend all court dates.</strong> Missing court dates results in bench warrants. If you can't make a court date, call us immediately to request an adjournment.</li>
