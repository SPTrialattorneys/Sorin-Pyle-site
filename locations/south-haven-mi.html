                <p class="text-align-center margin-bottom-lg">South Haven is a beautiful Lake Michigan beach town known for its stunning beaches, historic lighthouse, marina, and vibrant summer tourism. But with thousands of visitors each summer comes increased law enforcement presence and aggressive policing. Whether you're a year-round resident or a visitor arrested on vacation, you need an experienced criminal defense attorney who understands South Haven's unique legal environment. We defend DUI, BUI (boating under the influence), domestic violence, and all criminal charges in South Haven's 5A District Court and Van Buren County's 36th Circuit Court.</p>

                <h2>Why Choose a Criminal Defense Attorney for South Haven Cases?</h2>

                <p>South Haven's status as a popular summer resort town creates unique challenges for criminal defense. Here's why you need an attorney who understands this environment:</p>

                <div class="advantages-list margin-bottom-lg">
                    <div class="advantage-item">
                        <h4>📍 We Know South Haven's 5A District Court</h4>
                        <p>The 5A District Court in South Haven handles all misdemeanor cases and preliminary examinations for felonies in the city. This court sees a significant volume of tourist-related offenses during summer months—DUI arrests, boating violations, disorderly conduct, public intoxication, and beach-related crimes. We regularly appear in this court and understand how these cases are prosecuted in Van Buren County.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="advantage-item">
                        <h4>🚤 Experience with Boating Under the Influence (BUI)</h4>
                        <p>South Haven's location on Lake Michigan with its large marina and heavy recreational boating means BUI arrests are extremely common, especially during summer boating season. BUI charges carry the same penalties as DUI—jail time, fines, and a criminal record. We know how to challenge breathalyzer results on the water, question officer observations, and defend against marine enforcement tactics.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="advantage-item">
                        <h4>⚖️ Defending Tourists and Out-of-Town Defendants</h4>
                        <p>If you were arrested while visiting South Haven, you face additional complications—traveling back to Michigan for court dates, unfamiliarity with local courts, and difficulty finding local representation. We can appear on your behalf for many court dates, minimizing your travel burden. We also understand how prosecutors handle out-of-town defendants and can negotiate effectively on your behalf.</p>

                        <h4>🏛️ Trial Experience in Van Buren County's 36th Circuit Court</h4>
                        <p>Felony cases in South Haven are tried in the 36th Circuit Court in Paw Paw. We have trial experience in this court and know the judges, prosecutors, and procedures. This knowledge is critical when your case goes to trial or when negotiating serious felony charges.</p>

                        <h4>🌊 Understanding Seasonal Law Enforcement Patterns</h4>
                        <p>Law enforcement presence in South Haven increases dramatically during summer months, with heightened patrols on I-196, Phoenix Road, and on Lake Michigan. We understand how seasonal enforcement patterns affect cases and can challenge stops and arrests that may result from aggressive policing during high-traffic periods.</p>

                <h2>Common Criminal Charges in South Haven, MI</h2>

                <p>We defend South Haven residents and visitors against all types of criminal charges, including:</p>

                <div class="grid_2-col margin-bottom-lg">
                    <div>
                        <h3>DUI / OWI Charges</h3>
                        <p>South Haven sees frequent DUI arrests on I-196, Phoenix Road, Blue Star Highway (M-89), and local streets, especially during summer weekends and holiday periods. Police conduct traffic stops aggressively during peak tourist season. If you've been arrested for drunk driving in South Haven, we can challenge breathalyzer results, field sobriety tests, and police procedures. <a href="../dui-defense.html">Learn more about our DUI defense services</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Boating Under the Influence (BUI)</h3>
                        <p>BUI arrests are extremely common in South Haven due to heavy recreational boating on Lake Michigan and the marina area. Michigan State Police, Coast Guard, and local marine patrols conduct water stops throughout summer. BUI convictions carry the same penalties as DUI—up to 93 days in jail, fines up to $500, and a criminal record. We defend BUI cases by challenging sobriety testing on the water, officer training, and probable cause for the stop.</p>

                        <h3>Domestic Violence</h3>
                        <p>Domestic violence arrests can occur anywhere—including vacation rentals, hotels, and beach houses. Police are required to make an arrest when called to a domestic disturbance, even if no one was injured and the alleged victim doesn't want charges filed. Prosecutors in Van Buren County pursue these cases aggressively. We defend against false accusations, mutual combat situations, and cases where you acted in self-defense. <a href="../domestic-violence-defense.html">Learn more about domestic violence defense</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Disorderly Conduct & Public Intoxication</h3>
                        <p>Summer crowds, beach parties, and nightlife lead to disorderly conduct arrests in South Haven. These charges often stem from noise complaints, public intoxication on the beach, or altercations in bars and restaurants. While these may seem like minor charges, a conviction can result in a criminal record and impact employment. We work to have these charges dismissed or reduced to civil infractions.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Drug Charges</h3>
                        <p>Marijuana is legal in Michigan, but you can still be charged with possession of other drugs—cocaine, MDMA, prescription drugs, or mushrooms. Drug arrests in tourist areas like South Haven often result from traffic stops, hotel searches, or beach patrols. We defend all drug charges and work to get charges reduced or dismissed through diversion programs when possible.</p>

                        <h3>Assault & Battery</h3>
                        <p>Bar fights, beach altercations, and disputes at summer events can result in assault charges. We defend clients by demonstrating self-defense, challenging witness credibility, and negotiating reduced charges to avoid jail time and criminal records.</p>

                        <h3>Minor in Possession (MIP) & Fake ID Charges</h3>
                        <p>College students and young adults visiting South Haven frequently face MIP charges or fake ID violations when attempting to enter bars or purchase alcohol on the beach. These charges can impact college enrollment, scholarships, and future employment. We help young people protect their futures by getting charges dismissed or reduced.</p>

                        <h3>Trespassing & Beach-Related Offenses</h3>
                        <p>Trespassing on private beach property, violations of beach ordinances (glass containers, fires, noise), and other beach-related charges are common in South Haven during summer. We defend against these charges and work to have them dismissed or reduced to civil infractions.</p>
                    </div>

                <h2>South Haven's 5A District Court</h2>

                <p>The 5A District Court is located in South Haven and handles all criminal cases arising in the city. This court processes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>All misdemeanor cases</strong> (DUI, domestic violence, assault, disorderly conduct, BUI, MIP)</li>
                    <li><strong>Preliminary examinations</strong> for felony cases (before they're sent to Circuit Court)</li>
                    <li><strong>Traffic violations</strong> and marine violations</li>
                    <li><strong>Arraignments, pretrial conferences, and bench or jury trials</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you receive a court notice, it will tell you which courtroom to appear in and when. <strong>Never miss a court date</strong>—this results in a bench warrant for your arrest. If you've missed a court date, call us immediately at <strong>(616) 227-3303</strong> to resolve the warrant before you're arrested.</p>

                <h2>Protecting Your Rights in South Haven</h2>

                <p>When you're charged with a crime in South Haven, you're facing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Jail time (up to 93 days for misdemeanors, years for felonies)</li>
                    <li>Fines and court costs (often $1,000+ for DUI and BUI)</li>
                    <li>Probation with strict conditions</li>
                    <li>A permanent criminal record that appears on background checks</li>

                    <li>Difficulty finding housing</li>
                    <li>Immigration consequences (for non-citizens)</li>
                    <li>Loss of boating privileges (for BUI convictions)</li>
                    <li>Impact on professional licenses</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Our job is to protect you from these consequences. We investigate every case thoroughly, challenge the prosecution's evidence, and fight for dismissals, not guilty verdicts, or reduced charges. When trial isn't the best option, we negotiate aggressively for the most favorable outcome possible.</p>

                <h2>What to Do If You're Arrested in South Haven</h2>

                <p>If you're arrested by South Haven police, Van Buren County Sheriff's deputies, or Michigan State Police, follow these steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Remain silent.</strong> Do NOT talk to police without a lawyer present. Invoke your right to remain silent and request an attorney immediately. This applies whether you're arrested on land or on the water.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not consent to searches.</strong> Police may ask to search your car, boat, phone, hotel room, or rental property. Politely decline and say you do not consent to searches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Call an attorney immediately.</strong> The sooner we start working on your case, the better. Call us at <strong>(616) 227-3303</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not post about your case on social media.</strong> Prosecutors will review your Facebook, Instagram, and other accounts looking for evidence against you—including photos from your South Haven vacation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Document everything.</strong> Write down what happened while it's fresh in your mind, including names of witnesses, photos of the scene, and any evidence supporting your defense.</li>
                    <li><strong>For out-of-town defendants:</strong> Do not ignore court notices. If you cannot return to Michigan for court dates, contact us immediately—we can often appear on your behalf and minimize your travel requirements.</li>
                </ol>
