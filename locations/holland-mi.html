                <h2>Why Choose a Local Holland Attorney?</h2>

                <p>When you're charged with a crime in Holland, hiring a local attorney isn't just convenient—it's a strategic advantage. Here's why:</p>

                        <h4>📍 We Know Holland's 58th District Court</h4>
                        <p>The 58th District Court in Holland handles all misdemeanor cases and preliminary examinations for felonies in the city. We appear in this courthouse regularly—we know the judges, the court staff, the prosecutors, and how cases flow through the system. This familiarity allows us to navigate your case more effectively than an out-of-town attorney who's unfamiliar with local procedures.</p>

                    <div class="advantage-item">
                        <h4>⚖️ Relationships with Local Prosecutors</h4>
                        <p>We've built professional relationships with the Ottawa County Prosecutor's Office over years of practice. These relationships matter. While we're aggressive advocates for our clients, prosecutors know we're reasonable, prepared, and willing to fight when necessary. This reputation helps us negotiate better outcomes and resolve cases more favorably.</p>

                        <p>If your case involves felony charges, it will be tried in the 20th Circuit Court in Grand Haven. We have extensive trial experience in this court and understand the preferences and tendencies of the judges who will hear your case. This knowledge is invaluable during trial strategy and plea negotiations.</p>

                <h2>Common Criminal Charges in Holland, MI</h2>

                <p>We defend Holland residents against all types of criminal charges, including:</p>

                <div class="grid_2-col margin-bottom-lg">
                    <div>
                        <h3>DUI / OWI Charges</h3>
                        <p>Holland police conduct frequent traffic stops and DUI checkpoints, especially along major corridors like US-31, River Avenue, and downtown during Tulip Time and summer festivals. If you've been arrested for drunk driving in Holland, we can challenge breathalyzer results, field sobriety tests, and police procedures. <a href="../dui-defense.html">Learn more about our DUI defense services</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Domestic Violence</h3>
                        <p>Domestic violence arrests are common in Holland, and police are required to arrest someone whenever they're called to a domestic disturbance. Even if no one was injured and the alleged victim wants to drop charges, prosecutors often proceed anyway. We defend against false accusations, exaggerated claims, and situations where you were acting in self-defense. <a href="../domestic-violence-defense.html">Learn more about domestic violence defense</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Drug Charges</h3>
                        <p>Ottawa County takes drug offenses seriously. Whether you're facing possession of marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, prescription drugs, or more serious charges like possession with intent to deliver, we provide aggressive defense. Many drug cases can be resolved through diversion programs or reduced charges.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Theft & Retail Fraud</h3>
                        <p>Retail fraud (shoplifting) charges are prosecuted aggressively in Holland, with stores like Meijer, Walmart, and downtown retailers actively pursuing charges. Even first-time offenders face criminal records. We can often negotiate dismissals or reduce charges to avoid a theft conviction that will follow you for life.</p>

                        <h3>Assault & Battery</h3>
                        <p>Bar fights, disputes at Holland events, and altercations downtown can result in assault charges. We defend clients by demonstrating self-defense, challenging witness credibility, and negotiating reduced charges.</p>

                        <h3>Traffic Offenses</h3>
                        <p>Reckless driving, driving while license suspended (DWLS), leaving the scene of an accident, and other serious traffic offenses can result in jail time, license suspension, and a criminal record. We help Holland drivers protect their licenses and avoid convictions.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>All misdemeanor cases</strong> in Holland (DUI, domestic violence, assault, theft, etc.)</li>

                <p>If you receive a court notice, it will tell you which courtroom to appear in and when. <strong>Never miss a court date</strong>—this results in a bench warrant for your arrest.

                <p>When you're charged with a crime in Holland, you're facing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Jail time or prison sentences</li>

                    <li>Loss of gun rights (for domestic violence and felonies)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Our job is to protect you from these consequences. We investigate every case thoroughly, challenge the prosecution's evidence, and fight for dismissals, not guilty verdicts, or reduced charges. When trial isn't the best option, we negotiate aggressively for the most favorable outcome possible.</p>
