Crimes of dishonesty (theft, fraud, embezzlement, fake IDs) can result in denial of CPA licensure. Drug convictions, DUI, and other criminal records are scrutinized by the board. Even if you pass the CPA exam, the board conducts character and fitness review before granting certification. Davenport accounting students planning CPA careers cannot afford criminal convictions. The board can delay or deny certification for years, or permanently disqualify applicants with serious convictions."

            "text": "Yes, very likely. Most corporate internships, accounting firms, business organizations, and healthcare facilities conduct background checks before hiring. Many also have morality clauses in internship agreements requiring immediate disclosure of arrests. If you're arrested during an internship, you may be immediately terminated. This is particularly devastating for Davenport students because career-focused programs emphasize practical work experience. Losing an internship can set you back an entire semester or year, affect graduation timing, and damage relationships with employers crucial for post-graduation employment."

            "text": "Davenport's career services can provide resume assistance, interview preparation, and job search guidance regardless of criminal history. However, they cannot overcome the fundamental barrier: most employers conduct background checks. If you fail background screening, career services cannot help you get hired. This is particularly problematic at career-focused universities like Davenport where placement rates and employer relationships are central to the university's value proposition. Your degree becomes less valuable if you cannot pass employer screening for positions in your field."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "It depends on the conviction. The Michigan Board of Nursing conducts comprehensive criminal background checks on all nursing license applicants. Drug convictions (including marijuana for students under 21), theft, assault, and patient abuse charges can result in license denial. Even if charges are eventually dismissed, an arrest during clinical rotations can result in immediate removal from placement, preventing degree completion. Healthcare facilities conduct their own background checks for employment - many hospitals, nursing homes, and clinics will not hire nurses with any criminal history."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Davenport may find out through several channels: if the arrest occurred on campus (Davenport Security reports to Student Conduct), if you're required to report to your academic program (nursing, education programs require disclosure), if you miss classes for court appearances, if you seek academic accommodations or support, or if a conviction affects your financial aid. Additionally, many internship supervisors report student arrests to the university. Davenport's student conduct code allows disciplinary action for off-campus criminal behavior."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Possibly. Many employers conduct periodic background checks on current employees, especially in finance, healthcare, education, and management positions. If you're convicted of a crime while employed, your employer may terminate you. This is particularly devastating for Davenport's 48% part-time student population - many are working adults who depend on their current jobs to pay for school. Losing your job means losing tuition money and potentially dropping out of school. Some employers also have policies requiring immediate disclosure of arrests, and failing to disclose can be grounds for termination even if charges are later dismissed."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "It's difficult. Most universities ask about disciplinary action at your previous institution. If Davenport suspends or expels you for criminal conduct, that notation on your transcript makes transfer applications extremely challenging. Even if you're not disciplined by Davenport, many universities conduct their own background checks on transfer applicants. Criminal convictions can result in transfer application denial. Additionally, if you're receiving federal financial aid, drug convictions affect your eligibility at any institution, making it financially impossible to continue your education elsewhere."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Adult learners at Davenport face unique challenges: many are working professionals who risk losing current jobs if convicted, many have families depending on their income (job loss is catastrophic), many are pursuing career changes (criminal records prevent entry into new fields), and many cannot afford delays in graduation (every extra semester costs tuition and delays career advancement). Traditional students might recover from a setback, but adult learners often have one chance at career transition. A criminal conviction can permanently derail career-change plans that took years to arrange."

                <h2>Background Checks Are Career-Killers for Davenport Students</h2>
                <p>You didn't come to Davenport University for a generic liberal arts degree. <strong>You came here to launch a career.</strong></p>

                <p>Davenport is a private, career-focused university designed for one purpose: getting you workforce-ready and employed in your field upon graduation. Whether you're studying:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Business (20% of students):</strong> Accounting, finance, management, marketing</li>
                    <li><strong>Nursing:</strong> Registered nurse, healthcare leadership</li>
                    <li><strong>Accounting:</strong> CPA track, corporate accounting</li>
                    <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Computer information systems, cybersecurity</li>
                    <li><strong>Healthcare management:</strong> Medical billing, health services administration</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Every single one of these career paths has one thing in common: <strong>Employers conduct extensive background checks.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>A criminal conviction doesn't just affect your college experience - it destroys your employability in your chosen field.</strong></p>

                <p>Here's what Davenport students need to understand:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Corporate employers:</strong> Fortune 500 companies, major corporations, financial institutions - all conduct FBI background checks</li>
                    <li><strong>CPA firms:</strong> Big 4 accounting, regional accounting firms - criminal records disqualify applicants</li>
                    <li><strong>Healthcare facilities:</strong> Hospitals, nursing homes, clinics - state and federal background checks required</li>
                    <li><strong>Financial services:</strong> Banks, investment firms, insurance companies - theft and fraud convictions are automatic disqualifiers</li>
                    <li><strong>Management positions:</strong> Leadership roles require trustworthiness - criminal records raise red flags</li>
                    <li><strong>Professional licensing:</strong> CPA certification, nursing licensure - state boards review criminal history</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Your Davenport degree is worthless if you can't pass employer background checks.</strong></p>

                <p>You're scared. You're worried about losing your internship, your job (48% of Davenport students are part-time working adults), or your entire career path. You don't know what to do.</p>

                <p>At Sorin & Pyle, we understand that Davenport students are career-focused and practical. We don't judge. We don't lecture. We defend. We focus on protecting your employability and your future career.</p>

                <h2>Understanding Davenport's Career-Focused Student Population</h2>

                <h3>Traditional Students vs. Adult Learners</h3>
                <p>Davenport has a unique student population compared to traditional four-year universities:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Full-time students:</strong> 1,985 (52%)</li>
                    <li><strong>Part-time students:</strong> 1,848 (48%)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Nearly half of Davenport students are part-time adult learners who:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Work full-time while attending school</li>
                    <li>Have families depending on their income</li>
                    <li>Are pursuing career changes or advancement</li>
                    <li>Cannot afford to lose their current jobs</li>
                    <li>Have limited financial resources for legal problems</li>
                    <li>Face immediate employment consequences from criminal charges</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>For working adults, an arrest doesn't just threaten your education - it threatens your current livelihood and your family's financial security.</strong></p>

                <h3>Business Program Dominance</h3>
                <p>Approximately 20% of Davenport students are in business programs (accounting, finance, management, marketing). <strong>Business careers are particularly vulnerable to criminal records:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>CPA certification requires character and fitness review</li>
                    <li>Financial positions require trust and clean records</li>
                    <li>Management roles require leadership credibility</li>
                    <li>Corporate employers conduct thorough screening</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Understanding Dual Proceedings: Criminal Court vs. Davenport Discipline</h2>
                <p>Here's what most Davenport students don't realize: <strong>getting arrested doesn't just mean criminal court. You may also face a completely separate disciplinary process through Davenport's Student Conduct Office.</strong></p>

                <p>This means you could be fighting on two fronts simultaneously:</p>

                <h3>Criminal Court Proceedings (61st District Court / 17th Circuit Court)</h3>

                    <li>Potential outcomes: Conviction, plea deal, dismissal, diversion programs</li>
                    <li>Consequences: Jail time, fines, probation, permanent criminal record</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Davenport University Student Conduct Proceedings</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conducted by Davenport's Student Conduct Office</li>
                    <li>Lower burden of proof: "Preponderance of the evidence" (more likely than not)</li>
                    <li>Limited due process rights compared to criminal court</li>
                    <li>Potential outcomes: Warning, probation, suspension, expulsion</li>
                    <li>Consequences: Removal from academic programs, notation on transcript, expulsion</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Critical: Davenport can discipline you even if you're found not guilty in criminal court.</strong> The university can also take action for off-campus conduct.</p>

                <p>Additionally, some Davenport programs require students to self-report arrests:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nursing students:</strong> Must report arrests to program directors (accreditation requirement)</li>
                    <li><strong>Accounting students:</strong> May need to disclose for internships with CPA firms</li>
                    <li><strong>Students with internships:</strong> Internship agreements often require disclosure</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Failing to report when required can result in immediate dismissal - even if the criminal charges are eventually dropped.</p>

                <h2>Common Criminal Charges for Davenport University Students</h2>

                <h3>Minor in Possession of Alcohol (MIP)</h3>
                <p>MIP is common for younger Davenport students (though less common among part-time adult learners).</p>

                <p><strong>Michigan MIP Law (effective 2018):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>First offense:</strong> Civil infraction (not a criminal misdemeanor), fine up to $100</li>
                    <li><strong>Second offense:</strong> Misdemeanor, up to 30 days in jail, doubled fines</li>
                    <li><strong>Third offense:</strong> Misdemeanor, up to 60 days in jail, up to $500 fine</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why MIP matters for Davenport students:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Appears on background checks</li>
                    <li>Can trigger Davenport disciplinary action</li>
                    <li>May violate internship conduct agreements</li>
                    <li>Corporate employers view substance issues negatively</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Retail Fraud (Shoplifting) - CAREER-ENDING for Business Students</h3>
                <p>Retail fraud is particularly devastating for Davenport students pursuing business, accounting, and finance careers. <strong>Theft is a crime of dishonesty that permanently damages trustworthiness.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Why retail fraud is career-ending:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>CPA certification:</strong> Michigan Board of Accountancy views theft as disqualifying character flaw - CPA certification denied or delayed for years</li>
                    <li><strong>Finance positions:</strong> Banks, investment firms, financial services companies cannot hire people with theft convictions</li>
                    <li><strong>Management careers:</strong> Leadership positions require trustworthiness - theft convictions raise permanent questions</li>
                    <li><strong>Accounting firms:</strong> Big 4, regional firms, corporate accounting departments all disqualify theft convictions</li>
                    <li><strong>Internship termination:</strong> If you're arrested during an internship, you'll be immediately terminated</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Common scenarios for Davenport students:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shoplifting from retail stores (stress, financial pressure)</li>
                    <li>Taking merchandise from employer (part-time job theft)</li>
                    <li>Self-checkout "mistakes" (prosecuted as retail fraud)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Even if charges are eventually dismissed or reduced, the arrest alone can terminate internships and affect current employment.</strong></p>

                <h3>Embezzlement and Fraud - When Internships Go Wrong</h3>
                <p>This is a unique category for Davenport students. Career-focused programs emphasize internships and work experience. <strong>Sometimes students make terrible mistakes during internships:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Taking money from cash register at internship</li>
                    <li>Using company credit card for personal expenses</li>
                    <li>Falsifying expense reports</li>
                    <li>Unauthorized use of company assets</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These are felony charges that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Permanently disqualify from CPA certification</li>
                    <li>Prevent employment in finance, accounting, management</li>
                    <li>Result in immediate internship termination and possible civil lawsuits</li>
                    <li>Damage relationships with employers critical for post-graduation jobs</li>
                    <li>Can result in prison time, not just jail</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Fake ID Possession - Crime of Dishonesty</h3>
                <p>Using a fake ID is a misdemeanor in Michigan. For business students, this is particularly damaging:</p>

                <p><strong>Why fake IDs destroy business careers:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>CPA certification:</strong> Dishonesty offenses prevent certification</li>
                    <li><strong>Financial positions:</strong> Trust is essential - dishonesty is disqualifying</li>
                    <li><strong>Management careers:</strong> Leadership requires integrity - fake IDs indicate character problems</li>
                    <li><strong>Corporate culture:</strong> Business employers view dishonesty as fundamental character flaw</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Drug Possession Charges</h3>
                <p>Even though Michigan legalized recreational marijuana, <strong>it's still illegal for anyone under 21.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Why drug charges destroy Davenport students' careers:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nursing licensure:</strong> Michigan Board of Nursing denies licenses for drug convictions</li>
                    <li><strong>Healthcare employment:</strong> Hospitals, clinics, nursing homes conduct drug screening and background checks</li>
                    <li><strong>CPA certification:</strong> Substance abuse issues can prevent certification</li>
                    <li><strong>Corporate positions:</strong> Drug convictions indicate reliability and judgment problems</li>
                    <li><strong>Federal financial aid:</strong> Drug convictions affect FAFSA eligibility immediately</li>
                    <li><strong>Current employment:</strong> Many employers terminate employees with drug convictions</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>DUI/OWI Charges</h3>
                <p>Davenport students (especially adult learners who commute) face <a href="../dui-defense.html">DUI/OWI charges</a> when driving after drinking.</p>

                <p><strong>Why DUI is particularly damaging for career-focused students:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>License suspension:</strong> Adult learners depend on driving to get to work and school - license loss is catastrophic</li>
                    <li><strong>Employment termination:</strong> Many employers terminate employees convicted of DUI</li>
                    <li><strong>Professional licensing:</strong> CPA, nursing - state boards scrutinize DUI convictions</li>
                    <li><strong>Corporate positions:</strong> DUI indicates poor judgment and substance issues</li>
                    <li><strong>Internship loss:</strong> Internships require reliable transportation - license suspension means termination</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Domestic Violence Charges</h3>
                <p><a href="../domestic-violence-defense.html">Domestic violence charges</a> at Davenport often arise from:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Arguments between adult student couples (many Davenport students are older with established relationships)</li>
                    <li>Family stress (working adults balancing work, school, family)</li>
                    <li>Dating relationships among traditional students</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Davenport students face unique domestic violence consequences:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No-contact orders preventing class attendance</li>
                    <li>Title IX investigation parallel to criminal case</li>
                    <li>Employment termination (many employers have zero-tolerance DV policies)</li>
                    <li>Nursing licensure: Violence convictions can prevent state licensure</li>
                    <li>Corporate positions: Background checks disqualify DV convictions</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>CPA Certification and Accounting Career Protection</h2>

                <p>Approximately 20% of Davenport students are business majors, and many accounting students plan to become CPAs. <strong>The Michigan Board of Accountancy conducts thorough character and fitness reviews on all CPA applicants.</strong></p>

                <h3>CPA Certification Process</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Complete 150 credit hours of education (bachelor's + 30 additional credits)</li>
                    <li>Pass four sections of the CPA exam</li>
                    <li>Gain required work experience (typically 1-2 years)</li>
                    <li>Apply for CPA license through Michigan Board of Accountancy</li>
                    <li><strong>Pass character and fitness review (includes criminal background check)</strong></li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Criminal convictions that affect CPA certification:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Crimes of dishonesty:</strong> Theft, fraud, embezzlement, fake IDs - automatic denials or years of delays</li>
                    <li><strong>Financial crimes:</strong> Credit card fraud, check fraud, tax evasion</li>
                    <li><strong>Drug convictions:</strong> Substance abuse issues can delay or deny certification</li>
                    <li><strong>DUI:</strong> Multiple DUI convictions indicate substance problems</li>
                    <li><strong>Felony convictions:</strong> Most felonies result in certification denial</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Timeline impact:</strong> Even if the Board eventually approves you, the character review can take years. This means:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You graduate but cannot work as a CPA</li>
                    <li>You take entry-level accounting jobs instead of CPA-track positions</li>
                    <li>Your career is permanently behind your peers</li>
                    <li>Employers may rescind job offers if CPA certification is delayed</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Big 4 and Corporate Accounting Firms</h3>
                <p>Major accounting firms (Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG) and corporate accounting departments conduct extensive background checks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All offer letters are contingent on background check clearance</li>
                    <li>Criminal convictions result in offer rescission</li>
                    <li>Even internship offers require background checks</li>
                    <li>Theft, fraud, dishonesty convictions are automatic disqualifiers</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Nursing Licensure and Healthcare Career Protection</h2>

                <p>Davenport's nursing program prepares registered nurses. <strong>The Michigan Board of Nursing conducts comprehensive criminal background checks on all nursing license applicants.</strong></p>

                <h3>Michigan Nursing License Requirements</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Pass criminal background check (state and federal)</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Criminal convictions that prevent nursing licensure:</strong></p>

                    <li><strong>Assault/violence:</strong> Patient safety concerns</li>
                    <li><strong>Patient abuse:</strong> Automatic permanent denial</li>
                    <li><strong>Fraud:</strong> Cannot be trusted with patient records, insurance billing</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Clinical Rotations and Degree Completion</h3>
                <p>Before graduating, nursing students must complete clinical rotations at hospitals and healthcare facilities:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All facilities conduct background checks before accepting students</li>
                    <li>Criminal charges can prevent placement</li>
                    <li>Without clinical rotations, you cannot graduate</li>
                    <li>Arrests during rotations result in immediate removal</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Healthcare Employment Background Checks</h3>
                <p>Hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, and healthcare facilities conduct federal background checks (FBI) for all employees:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Drug convictions disqualify</li>
                    <li>Theft disqualifies</li>
                    <li>Violence disqualifies</li>
                    <li>Many healthcare employers have zero-tolerance policies</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Impact on Working Adults and Part-Time Students</h2>

                <p>Davenport's 48% part-time student population faces unique challenges that traditional college students don't experience:</p>

                <h3>Current Employment at Risk</h3>
                <p>Many employers conduct periodic background checks on current employees. <strong>If you're convicted of a crime while employed, you may be immediately terminated:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Financial services jobs (banks, credit unions, investment firms)</li>
                    <li>Healthcare positions (hospitals, nursing, medical billing)</li>
                    <li>Government positions (require clean records)</li>
                    <li>Education positions (teachers, school administrators)</li>
                    <li>Management positions (companies require trustworthy leaders)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>For working adults, losing your job means:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cannot pay tuition - must drop out of Davenport</li>
                    <li>Cannot pay rent/mortgage - risk losing housing</li>
                    <li>Cannot support family - financial devastation</li>
                    <li>Wasted investment - years of part-time study lost</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Career Change Plans Derailed</h3>
                <p>Many Davenport adult learners are pursuing career changes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Transitioning from blue-collar to white-collar careers</li>
                    <li>Moving from retail/service to professional positions</li>
                    <li>Seeking advancement and higher income</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>A criminal conviction destroys career-change plans:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cannot pass background checks for new career field</li>
                    <li>Stuck in current job with no advancement opportunities</li>
                    <li>Years of part-time education wasted</li>
                    <li>Financial investment lost with no return</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Family and Financial Pressure</h3>
                <p>Adult learners often have:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spouses and children depending on their income</li>
                    <li>Mortgages, car payments, and other financial obligations</li>
                    <li>Limited savings to handle legal problems</li>
                    <li>No parental financial support available</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>The stakes are much higher for working adults than for traditional college students.</strong></p>

                <h2>Internship Loss and Career Services Impact</h2>

                <h3>Internship Termination</h3>
                <p>Davenport's career-focused programs emphasize practical work experience. <strong>Internships are critical for post-graduation employment. Losing an internship can set your career back years.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>What happens when you're arrested during an internship:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most internship agreements require disclosure of arrests</li>
                    <li>Employers conduct background checks - arrests appear immediately</li>
                    <li>Morality clauses in agreements allow immediate termination</li>
                    <li>Employer relationships damaged - affects future job references</li>
                    <li>Cannot complete internship credit required for graduation</li>
                    <li>Must find new internship (difficult with criminal record)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Career Services Limitations</h3>
                <p>Davenport's career services can provide resume help, interview prep, and job search guidance. <strong>But they cannot overcome the fundamental barrier: employer background checks.</strong></p>

                <p>If you fail background screening:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Career services cannot help you get hired</li>
                    <li>Your degree becomes less valuable</li>
                    <li>Employer relationships cultivated by career services are useless to you</li>
                    <li>Placement rates don't include students who fail screening</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Protecting Your Financial Aid and Scholarships</h2>

                <h3>Federal Financial Aid</h3>
                <ul>

                <h2>International Student Immigration Consequences</h2>

                <p>Davenport enrolls international students. International students on F-1 visas face severe consequences from criminal charges:</p>

                <h3>Visa Status Risks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Criminal convictions can result in visa revocation</li>
                    <li>Drug convictions can trigger deportation proceedings</li>
                    <li>Crimes of moral turpitude (theft, fraud, assault) can make you inadmissible</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Maintaining Legal Status</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If Davenport suspends you, you lose F-1 status (no longer enrolled full-time)</li>
                    <li>Loss of F-1 status requires immediate departure from the U.S.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>International students must consult with both a criminal defense attorney and an immigration attorney.</strong></p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions - Davenport University Student Defense</h2>

                <h3>Can I become a CPA with a criminal conviction?</h3>
                <p>CPA certification through the Michigan Board of Accountancy requires full disclosure of criminal history. Crimes of dishonesty (theft, fraud, embezzlement, fake IDs) can result in denial of CPA licensure. Drug convictions, DUI, and other criminal records are scrutinized. Even if you pass the CPA exam, the board conducts character and fitness review before granting certification. The board can delay or deny certification for years, or permanently disqualify applicants with serious convictions.</p>

                <h3>Will I lose my internship if I'm arrested?</h3>
                <p>Very likely. Most corporate internships conduct background checks and have morality clauses requiring disclosure of arrests. If you're arrested during an internship, you may be immediately terminated. This is particularly devastating for Davenport students because career-focused programs emphasize practical work experience. Losing an internship can set you back an entire semester or year and damage employer relationships crucial for post-graduation employment.</p>

                <h3>Will Davenport career services still help me with a criminal record?</h3>
                <p>Davenport's career services can provide resume assistance and job search guidance regardless of criminal history. However, they cannot overcome the fundamental barrier: most employers conduct background checks. If you fail background screening, career services cannot help you get hired. Your degree becomes less valuable if you cannot pass employer screening for positions in your field.</p>

                <h3>Can I still become a nurse with a criminal conviction?</h3>
                <p>It depends on the conviction. The Michigan Board of Nursing conducts comprehensive criminal background checks. Drug convictions, theft, assault, and patient abuse charges can result in license denial. Even if charges are eventually dismissed, an arrest during clinical rotations can result in immediate removal from placement, preventing degree completion.</p>

                <h3>I'm a part-time student working full-time. Will my arrest affect my job?</h3>
                <p>Possibly. Many employers conduct periodic background checks on current employees, especially in finance, healthcare, education, and management. If you're convicted while employed, your employer may terminate you. This is devastating for working adults who depend on their current jobs to pay for school. Losing your job means losing tuition money and potentially dropping out.</p>
