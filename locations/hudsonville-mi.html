                <p>We defend Hudsonville residents against all types of criminal charges, including:</p>

                <div class="grid_2-col margin-bottom-lg">
                    <div>
                        <h3>DUI / OWI Charges</h3>
                        <p>Hudsonville police conduct regular traffic enforcement along Chicago Drive (M-21), 32nd Avenue, and residential streets. DUI arrests spike during summer evenings and weekends when residents are returning home from events in Grand Rapids or Holland. We challenge breathalyzer results, field sobriety tests, and police procedures to fight your drunk driving charges. <a href="../dui-defense.html">Learn more about our DUI defense services</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Domestic Violence</h3>
                        <p>Domestic violence arrests are common in Hudsonville, as they are throughout Michigan. Police are required to arrest someone when called to a domestic disturbance, even if the situation was blown out of proportion or involved mutual conflict. We defend against false accusations, exaggerated claims, and situations where you were protecting yourself or your children. <a href="../domestic-violence-defense.html">Learn more about domestic violence defense</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Drug Charges</h3>
                        <p>Ottawa County prosecutes drug offenses aggressively, even in suburban communities like Hudsonville. Whether you're facing possession of marijuana, prescription drugs, or more serious charges like possession with intent to deliver, we provide aggressive defense.

                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Retail Fraud & Theft</h3>
                        <p>Theft charges in Hudsonville often stem from incidents at local retailers like Meijer, Family Fare, or businesses along Chicago Drive. Even first-time shoplifting arrests can result in criminal convictions that follow you for life. We negotiate dismissals, diversion programs, or reduced charges to protect your record.</p>

                        <h3>Assault & Battery</h3>
                        <p>Assault charges can arise from disputes between neighbors, altercations at local schools or sporting events, or confrontations that escalated beyond control. We defend clients by demonstrating self-defense, challenging witness credibility, and negotiating reduced charges.</p>

                        <h3>Traffic Offenses</h3>
                        <p>Serious traffic offenses like reckless driving, driving while license suspended (DWLS), and leaving the scene of an accident can result in criminal records, jail time, and loss of your license. We help Hudsonville residents protect their driving privileges and avoid convictions.</p>
