The prosecutor must present evidence to convince the judge that there is probable cause to believe a felony was committed and that the defendant committed it. If the judge agrees, the case is bound over (transferred) to the Circuit Court for trial. It is a critical opportunity for your attorney to challenge the prosecution's evidence early on."

Typically, the defendant agrees to plead guilty to a lesser charge or to one of several charges in exchange for a more lenient sentence or the dismissal of other charges. It avoids the risk and expense of a trial, but it's crucial to have an experienced attorney negotiate on your behalf to ensure the deal is in your best interest."
