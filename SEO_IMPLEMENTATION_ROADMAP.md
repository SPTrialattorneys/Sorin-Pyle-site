## 🎯 Priority Matrix: What to Do When

### TIER 1: Do These IMMEDIATELY (Week 1)
Impact: 🔴 CRITICAL | Effort: Medium | Results: Fast

1. [x] Create DUI defense page (✅ COMPLETED 10/12/2025)
2. [x] Create domestic violence defense page (✅ COMPLETED 10/12/2025)
3. [ ] Optimize Google Business Profile completely (⏳ NEXT PRIORITY)
4. [x] Fix duplicate script tags (✅ COMPLETED 10/12/2025)
5. [ ] Set up review request process

**Why These First:** These five actions address your biggest SEO gaps and provide fastest ROI. The DUI/DV pages capture high-intent searches you're currently missing. GBP optimization improves Map Pack rankings immediately. Technical fixes ensure professional code.

**PROGRESS UPDATE (10/12/2025):** ✅ Both DUI and Domestic Violence defense pages completed (11,500+ combined words, 17 FAQ questions, enhanced schemas). Technical fixes complete. **40% of Tier 1 tasks done.** Next priority: Google Business Profile optimization.

---

### TIER 2: Do These NEXT (Weeks 2-4)
Impact: 🟠 HIGH | Effort: High | Results: Medium

6. ✅ Create Holland, MI city page
7. ✅ Create Grand Rapids, MI city page
8. ✅ Create Grand Haven, MI city page
9. ✅ Expand all county pages to 500+ words
10. ✅ Begin review generation campaign (20 requests)

**Why These Second:** City pages capture specific city searches your county pages miss. Review generation builds the trust signals that influence Map Pack rankings. Expanded county content improves relevance and time-on-page.

---

### TIER 3: Content Expansion (Weeks 5-8)
Impact: 🟡 MEDIUM-HIGH | Effort: High | Results: Slow-Medium

11. ✅ Create DUI FAQ page
12. ✅ Create domestic violence FAQ page
13. ✅ Write 2-4 blog articles
14. ✅ Create 5 more city pages
15. ✅ Add FAQ sections to service pages

**Why These Third:** Question-based content captures voice search and featured snippets. Blog content builds authority and attracts backlinks. Additional city pages expand geographic coverage.

---

### TIER 4: Long-Term Growth (Weeks 9-12 and ongoing)
Impact: 🟢 MEDIUM | Effort: Medium | Results: Slow

16. ✅ Citation building (25+ directories)
17. ✅ Schema markup enhancements
18. ✅ Conversion optimization implementations
19. ✅ Link building partnerships
20. ✅ Monthly content marketing

**Why These Last:** These build long-term authority and domain strength. Results compound over time but aren't as immediately impactful as service pages and GBP optimization.
