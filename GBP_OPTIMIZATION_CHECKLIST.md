---

## ✅ PHASE 1: Essential Information (Complete First)

### Business Name
- [ ] Verify exact name: **Sorin & Pyle, PC**
- [ ] Do NOT add keywords to name (Google penalty)
- [ ] Match exactly with website and all citations

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ "Sorin & Pyle Criminal Defense Attorneys" (keyword stuffing)
- ❌ "Sorin & Pyle, P.C." (inconsistent capitalization)
- ✅ "Sorin & Pyle, PC" (correct)

---

### Primary Category (MOST IMPORTANT RANKING FACTOR)
- [ ] Set primary category to: **Criminal Defense Attorney**
- [ ] Verify it's set as PRIMARY (not secondary)

**Why This Matters:** Primary category is the #1 signal for what searches you appear in. "Criminal Defense Attorney" is specific and high-value. "Attorney" or "Lawyer" is too generic.

---

### Secondary Categories (Add ALL That Apply)
- [ ] **DUI Attorney**
- [ ] **Trial Attorney**
- [ ] **Legal Services**
- [ ] Lawyer (as fallback only if allowed 4th category)

**Rules:**
- Maximum 10 categories, but quality over quantity
- Only add categories for services you actively provide
- More specific = better than generic

---

### Address (NAP Consistency Critical)
- [ ] Verify exact format: **217 E 24th St Ste 107, Holland, MI 49423**
- [ ] Ensure it matches website footer exactly
- [ ] Ensure it matches all directory citations exactly

**Critical:** ANY variation in address format across the web hurts rankings. Must be identical everywhere.

**Format Rules:**
- ✅ "217 E 24th St Ste 107" (correct)
- ❌ "217 E. 24th St. Suite 107" (periods inconsistent with website)
- ❌ "217 East 24th Street Ste 107" (spelled out vs abbreviated)

---

### Phone Number
- [ ] Verify: **(616) 227-3303**
- [ ] Use EXACTLY this format everywhere (parentheses around area code)
- [ ] This should be a local Michigan number (it is - good!)
- [ ] Do NOT use call tracking number (confuses Google)

**Format Consistency:**
- ✅ "(616) 227-3303" (correct)
- ❌ "616-227-3303" (inconsistent)
- ❌ "616.227.3303" (inconsistent)
- ❌ "1-616-227-3303" (inconsistent)

---

### Website URL
- [ ] Set to: **https://www.sorinpyle.com**
- [ ] Include "www" (since your site redirects to www)
- [ ] Verify it's clickable and working

---

### Business Hours
- [ ] Monday: **9:00 AM - 5:00 PM**
- [ ] Tuesday: **9:00 AM - 5:00 PM**
- [ ] Wednesday: **9:00 AM - 5:00 PM**
- [ ] Thursday: **9:00 AM - 5:00 PM**
- [ ] Friday: **9:00 AM - 5:00 PM**
- [ ] Saturday: **Closed** (or "By Appointment Only" if accurate)
- [ ] Sunday: **Closed** (or "By Appointment Only" if accurate)

**Special Hours:**
- [ ] Add holiday hours for major holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's, etc.)
- [ ] Update immediately if hours change temporarily

**Pro Tip:** If you take emergency calls 24/7, add this in business description, not hours. Only list regular office hours here.

---

### Service Areas (Geographic Targeting)
- [ ] Add all 7 counties you serve:
  - **Ottawa County**
  - **Kent County**
  - **Allegan County**
  - **Kalamazoo County**
  - **Muskegon County**
  - **Van Buren County**
  - **Newaygo County**

  - **Zeeland**
  - **Hudsonville**
  - **Kalamazoo**
  - **Muskegon**
  - **Allegan**
  - **Paw Paw**
  - **Coopersville**

**Why This Matters:** Service areas determine what geographic searches you appear for. More specific = better targeting.

---

### Attributes (Trust Signals)

## 🚨 Common GBP Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Keyword Stuffing in Business Name
**DON'T:** "Sorin & Pyle Criminal Defense Attorneys DUI Lawyers Holland MI"
**DO:** "Sorin & Pyle, PC"

**Why:** Google suspends profiles for keyword stuffing in business name. It's against guidelines and you'll lose your profile.

---

### Mistake #2: Using PO Box or Virtual Office
**DON'T:** List PO Box or virtual office as address
**DO:** List actual physical office where you meet clients

**Why:** Google requires street address where business operates. PO boxes get flagged.

---

### Mistake #3: Inconsistent NAP Across Web
**DON'T:** Different address formats on website vs GBP vs directories
**DO:** Use EXACT same format everywhere

**Why:** Inconsistency confuses Google and hurts local rankings significantly.

---

### Mistake #4: Ignoring Reviews
**DON'T:** Never respond to reviews
**DO:** Respond to ALL reviews within 24-48 hours

**Why:** Response rate is a ranking factor. Shows engagement.

---

### Mistake #5: One-Time Setup, Then Neglect
**DON'T:** Set up profile once, never update
**DO:** Post weekly, add photos monthly, continuously manage

**Why:** Freshness is a ranking signal. Active profiles outrank stale ones.

---

### Mistake #6: Fake Reviews or Review Gating
**DON'T:**
- Write fake reviews
- Ask friends/family to review
- Only ask satisfied clients (review gating)
- Pay for reviews

**DO:**
- Only request from actual clients
- Ask ALL clients (let them decide whether to review)
- Never incentivize reviews

**Why:** Google detects fake reviews and suspends profiles. Review gating violates Google policy.

---

### Mistake #7: Wrong Primary Category
**DON'T:** Set primary as "Lawyer" or "Attorney"
**DO:** Set primary as "Criminal Defense Attorney"

**Why:** Primary category determines what searches you appear in. Specific beats generic.

---

### Mistake #8: Posting Too Infrequently
**DON'T:** Post once a month or less
**DO:** Post weekly (minimum)

**Why:** Regular posting signals active business to Google.
