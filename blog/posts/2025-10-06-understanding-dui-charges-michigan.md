If you've been charged with DUI (Driving Under the Influence) or OWI (Operating While Intoxicated) in Michigan, you're likely feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about what comes next. Understanding the charges against you is the first step in building a strong defense.

## What is OWI in Michigan?

Michigan law defines Operating While Intoxicated (OWI) as operating a vehicle with a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.08% or higher. Unlike some states, Michigan uses the term "OWI" instead of "DUI," but the implications are serious either way.

### Different Types of OWI Charges

Michigan recognizes several levels of impaired driving offenses:

- **OWI (Operating While Intoxicated)**: BAC of 0.08% or higher
- **High BAC**: BAC of 0.17% or higher - carries enhanced penalties
- **OWVI (Operating While Visibly Impaired)**: Less severe than OWI but still a serious charge
- **OWI 2nd/3rd**: Repeat offenses carry increasingly severe penalties

## Potential Penalties

The consequences of an OWI conviction in Michigan can be severe:

**First Offense:**
- Up to 93 days in jail
- Fines up to $500
- Up to 360 hours of community service
- Driver's license suspension for 30 days, followed by restrictions for 150 days
- Possible ignition interlock device requirement

**Second Offense (within 7 years):**
- Up to 1 year in jail
- Fines between $200 and $1,000
- License revocation for minimum of 1 year
- Mandatory vehicle immobilization

**Third Offense:**
- Felony charge
- Up to 5 years in prison
- Fines up to $5,000
- License revocation for minimum of 1 year

## Common Defenses

Every OWI case is unique, and there are numerous potential defenses:

1. **Improper Traffic Stop**: Police must have reasonable suspicion to stop your vehicle
2. **Faulty Breathalyzer**: Breathalyzer devices must be properly calibrated and maintained
3. **Field Sobriety Test Issues**: These tests are subjective and can be challenged
4. **Medical Conditions**: Certain conditions can affect BAC readings
5. **Violation of Rights**: Any violation of your constitutional rights can impact the case

## Your Rights During a DUI Stop

You have important rights that law enforcement must respect:

- You have the right to remain silent
- You have the right to refuse field sobriety tests (though this may result in license sanctions)
- You have the right to an attorney
- Chemical test refusal has consequences but is your right

## Why Legal Representation Matters

OWI cases are complex, involving technical evidence, scientific testimony, and constitutional issues. An experienced criminal defense attorney can:

- Challenge the legality of the traffic stop
- Question the accuracy of chemical tests
- Negotiate for reduced charges
- Protect your driving privileges
- Fight for the best possible outcome
